"This web site is owned and operated by Smart Projects. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to explain how we treat data obtained through your visits to our web site or when you use or buy our products or services. It will also make a distinction between what **we** do and what third parties are able to see or track via your visits to our website, or when you use of our products and services For each visitor to our web site we may use limited information about the visitor to present the most relevant content. Visitor systems are not probed in any way to retrieve personal information, only the standard information sent by the browser can possibly be used. In other words, limited information such country of origin (via your IP), which web browser, version of your web browser etc. This sort of information may also be stored and used for statistical purposes, to understand and serve our visitors best. You are never personally tracked. Just aggregated information may be stored to understand where our users come from, what type browsers they use, how many downloads there are per day and so on. About cookies. A cookie is a small amount of text data that is transferred to your browser and it is stored on your system in a folder managed by your browser. The cookie is sent back to the website, that initially sent it, on every visit. Smart Projects uses cookies **but not** the kind that can identify or track you personally. We **only** use 'session cookies', that expire (and are deleted) when you close your browser. We are hence not able to recognize you as a returning visitor. We only use these temporary cookies to store choices made on the web site, such as language information, provided coupon etc., so that we can remember the information while you are browsing the website. In other words, to provide you with a pleasant experience and possibly make your life easier. Our website content is currently managed and updated in house. We do not use a third party for any of that. The website's physical location, security updates and bandwidth are provided by a hosting company. We use [knownhost.com](https://www.knownhost.com/ ""knownhost.com"") for that, and the managed virtual server allocated to us is located in the USA. We use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/ ""Google Analytics"") to track visits to our website, to help us monitor and improve the website. We also may use [Google Adwords](https://adwords.google.com/ ""Google Adwords"") and [Bing Adcenter](https://bingads.microsoft.com/ ""Bing Adcenter"") conversion code so that we can monitor the success of our pay per click advertising. All of this only provides us with aggregate data. We cannot identify individuals from this data. Our website tries to integrate nicely with social media and tries to offer a good user experience. By doing so we incorporate small widgets that run off the social media platforms. This is done by showing something that comes directly from the social media website. For instance, to see how many people liked [our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/isobuster ""Facebook""), or who in your network liked the IsoBuster Facebook page before. There is also a button to easily tweet about the website, and a Google+ button to like the page in Google's social network. [Addthis.com](http://www.addthis.com/ ""Addthis.com"") also provides a widget on some pages to quickly share the content in your social network. All this is meant to improve your experience. We do not receive any tracking nor personal information about you from these sites. What you get to see via these widgets is between you and the social media website that possibly recognizes you (if you have an account with them) and shows you something that makes sense to you. Certain pages feature the ability to directly chat we us. We use third party [tawk.to](https://www.tawk.to/ ""Tawk.to"") for that. We can only access aggregate data from them. We cannot identify individuals from this data. We do keep discussions we had with you, and whatever information you volunteered, to be able to continue a conversation at a later date. Certain pages feature the ability to leave comments and have discussions. We use third party [disqus.com](https://www.disqus.com/ ""disqus.com"") for that. We can only access aggregate data from them. We cannot identify individuals from this data. Of course we show comments you made (after logging in to disqus.com) visible on the page where you left it. We only collect personal information that is freely and knowingly volunteered by the visitor or customer, such as via [newsletter subscriptions](https://www.isobuster.com/subscribe.php ""Subscribe""), [product or service purchases](https://www.isobuster.com/bn.php ""Buy"") or [support requests](https://www.isobuster.com/support.php#contact ""Contact us"") The email address database is securely stored on the server and contains the bare minimum information. It contains your email address (if you [subscribed to the newsletter](https://www.isobuster.com/subscribe.php ""Subscribe to newsletter"") or if you [purchased a license](https://www.isobuster.com/bn.php ""Buy IsoBuster"") to use the software), your name and an ID we can use to deduce your type software license (not the license itself). You can always [un-subscribe](https://www.isobuster.com/unsubscribe.php ""Unsubscribe"") from this database. No other personally identifiable information is stored on the server. The email address database is used to notify you about updates to our web site or products, and/or to deliver and follow up on purchased goods or services and/or to respond to posted queries or remarks. Your email address is never shared with others and only one person in the organization has access to it. License keys resulting from [purchases](https://www.isobuster.com/bn.php ""Buy IsoBuster"") are always sent via email. Continued support by letting you know there's a more recent version (typically twice a year) is an implicit part of your [purchase](https://www.isobuster.com/bn.php ""Buy IsoBuster"") and requires the email database. We never ever send spam. People who subscribed to the newsletter, which needs to be done explicitly [here](https://www.isobuster.com/subscribe.php ""Subscribe to newsletter""), independent from a purchase or not, will possibly get a few more emails, but not a lot. Mainly to announce [beta versions](https://www.isobuster.com/betadownload.php ""IsoBuster Beta"") when they are released or to possibly inform you of other relevant information about us and our products. We retain all emails sent to us, so that we have a record of our interactions with customers and people seeking advice. This to provide the best possible support. Our emails are hosted by Google, only accessible by one person in the organization and secured by several layers of protection, completely disconnected from the website (and website server). If you purchase a license via our website the payment is processed by eCommerce providers [payproglobal.com](https://payproglobal.com/ ""PayProGlobal.com"") or [avangate.com](http://www.avangate.com/ ""Avangate.com""). They pass some of your details on to us, such as your IP address, name, email address and postal address. We retain this information securely so that we can resend your license key if you lose it, check your eligibility for upgrades and better serve you during support requests. Complete removal of these details means your purchased product(s) will stop working in the future and you won't be able to get support anymore. This information is stored entirely disconnected from the website and only one person in the organization has access to it. We **never** receive your financial details (e.g. your credit card number) and hence do not store it! Software produced and/or provided by Smart Projects may check the servers from time to time, to see if there is a more recent version of the software available. You can disable this in the options of the software. During the short online query, the software may send along limited information about your system, such as OS and OS version, Software version, License information etc. to be able to present you with the correct update for your product, but also to track abuse and fraudulent use. This securely logged information is only kept briefly on the server. Parts of the non personally identifiable information (language, OS etc.) may be stored long term and used for statistical purposes, to understand and be able to serve our customers best. Your use of our site(s), materials, products, software or services constitutes your acceptance of the privacy policy.

If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use it as described in “How We May Collect Other Information” section above, as well as for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.

"## www.datalounge.com This statement covers the site datalounge.com (""The DataLounge"" and/or the ""Site"") which is proved by Mediapolis inc. (""Mediapolis"" and/or ""we"") and any associated content such as email, text messages, and possible subliminal suggestions. Please read this statement carefully before proceeding to access The DataLounge. Your use of The DataLounge indicates your agreement to abide by these terms below. Yes it does. Don't argue. Thank you.  ## Your Privacy Matters to Us (even though it might not to our government and certain litigious personalities) The DataLounge recognizes there are dual privacy concerns for our users. First, you want to know what personal information is collected when you come to this, or any, web site. Second, as a person who identifies as a member of the greater LGBT communities or as a person who may have same-sex encounters without identifying with any community, you may have a strong interest in keeping your personal orientations or behaviors private.  Now if that's not PC, we're in the wrong business.  ## What We Gather and Track The DataLounge collects two types of visitor data: 1) personally identifiable information that you give voluntarily through newsletter subscriptions, registration and/or memberships; and 2) tracking information which is collected each time a visitor comes to the Site.  ## What We Don't Gather and Track  The DataLounge has little interest in gathering the following items: your mother's maiden name, your pet's name, who taught your first grade class, what time the Superbowl starts, curds and whey.  ## How the Information Is Used Unlike the radical right, The DataLounge does not rent, sell or otherwise share any personally identifiable information about our users. We will not transfer any such personal information to any third parties (who will then hound you to the brink of conversion), unless we explicitly state otherwise at the point the information is collected (e.g. contests or sweepstakes) or as may be required by law or as we think necessary to protect our company or others from injury (for example, in response to a court order or subpoena or in response to a law enforcement agency request).  Personally-identifiable information in the form of e-mail addresses is used to send newsletters and other alerts that you have signed up for. No other personally-identifiable data is collected except for those brave, progressive thinkers who contribute to us, thus improving their lives and the lives of those around them. In these noteworthy instances we need to collect email and street addresses, telephone and credit card numbers in order to process payments. Credit card information is deleted upon completion of the transaction. Contact information is only used to re-contact you after your one year contribution has expired or to send you a membership premium you requested.  The heaven sent fact that you have made a contribution will be tracked in a cookie (a small individual data file deposited in each visitor's web browser), but no personal information will be tracked in this cookie -- only the fact that you have contributed. This cookie will give you the option to block the irritating contribution ads we run on the Site from time to time. Please note, and please note this well, contributions do not bestow a right to post. Most especially if you get out-of-control. See guidelines below.  ## Terms of Use We do not require you to identify yourself to participate in our forum (although it's always nice to know the identity of guests in your own home). However, we ask users to post responsible comments. In order to make our forum interesting and informative for our users (that's you!), the following guidelines must be adhered to by all users posting and/or viewing comments: If a comment is made using your authenticated identity, it will be deemed to have been posted by you.   * Please do not post abusive, obscene, threatening, harassing, defamatory, libelous, fraudulent, offensive or sexually explicit material or material that is invasic of another's privacy or publicity rights. You don't like it when someone calls you a bad name; you must assume she or he won't like it either.   * Please do not intentionally make false or misleading statements (or you may not get re-elected).   * Please do not offer to sell or buy any product or service. The internet is a scary place, and there are scary people who just wait to lead your astray, so you'd better mind your p's and q's.   * Please do not post any personal information. See above re: scary people out there.   * Please do not impersonate, or misrepresent your affiliation with, any other person or entity. Remember, you are best you that can be - no one else if better at being you! If you try to be someone else, you can only be second best.   * Please do not post material that infringes copyright or other intellectual property rights.  * Please do not post information that you know to be confidential or sensitive or otherwise in breach of the law.   * Please do not use this Site in an unlawful manner or to promote unlawful conduct or in a manner likely to give rise to civil liability. We think that's a bit obvious but sometimes you just have to smack people upside the head with the obvious and even then...  * Please do your best to keep all comments relevant and ""on topic"" to the particular thread. (We know how trying this can be, but sometimes you just have to put the pen down, peg.)   * Finally, and most importantly, The DataLounge will not accept responsibility for information posted in the forum(s). You posted it - take your medicine and suck it up. We are not your mother, though you may treat us like her. Why don't you write more often? And by the way, how dare you treat your mother like that! If The DataLounge receives notice that any posting is not in keeping with these terms and conditions or the intended use of the Site, The DataLounge may remove that posting and/or any other related postings as well as restrict posting privileges.  We reserve the right, as we must, to give you a time out from the DataLounge, temporarily or permanently, by means at our disposal at any time in our sole discretion. Just want to make sure we all are onboard about this little bit of housekeeping. Sounds scary, right? You betcha. Sister Rita taught us in the 5th grade made who was in charge and boy-howdy we learned that lesson well. Just passing on the love.  Please note that unless The DataLounge is notified of a posting that is not in keeping with these terms and conditions, then it may not be removed. Furthermore we do not exercise any form of editorial control or censorship of the forum other than the above stated procedure.  ## Use of Content By using and/or posting on The DataLounge, you acknowledge that we own and have the right to republish, re-issue, regurgitate, recreate derivative works of, redistribute, reproduce, relicense and re-etc., the content herein created by yourself in any media now known or hereafter devised in perpetuity, irrevocably. (Imagine that we might someday be able to transmit The DataLounge directly into your brain! Maybe we already can!)  ## External Link Disclaimer The DataLounge does not monitor or control information on web sites that we link to, or those linked to by our users -- including the anonymous trolls (whom we adore, in our own tough love kind of way). For privacy information outside of The DataLounge, please refer the privacy policies posted on those sites.  ## Notification of Changes Whenever The DataLounge changes these Terms, we will post those changes to this statement and other places we deem appropriate so our users will be aware. And an aware user is a responsible and happy user. Knowlege is power. We may change this statement from time to time by posting changes here, which take effect on the date posted. If you continue to use the Site after any such changes, that also indicates your agreement to those changes. If you don't agree to the terms and conditions herein you must discontinue using this Site. It's a playground and teacher sets the rules. See Sister Rita above. Shiver.  ## Contact Information If you have any questions or notices of violations to these terms and conditions, or perhaps you are just feeling lonely, please contact us at webmaster@datalounge.com or via post at The DataLounge, c/o Mediapolis, inc., 511 6th Ave., #339, New York, NY 10011  ## Final Note  The DataLounge is a wonderfully, horrible and untamed beast that many try to ride, some successfully, some abysmally. But remember this: information is only as good as it's source. You are responsbile for what you post and you make the choice whether to believe what you read here or not, much like making the choice whether to believe what you see on .... well, Fox News for instance.

For session ID cookies, once you close your browser or log out, the cookie terminates and is erased. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your computer’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Your browser’s help file contains information and instructions for removing persistent cookies. Session ID cookies may be used by Site5 to track user preferences while the user is using our Services. They also help to minimize load times and save on server processing.

In case Site5 is sold, the information collected from users may be transferred to the new owners. Site5 may from time to time engage third parties, including its own subsidiaries and affiliated companies, to preserve, analyze or otherwise store or manipulate data received by Site5 from its customers.

Service Announcements On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement, if, for instance, our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. ## 9\. Legal Disclaimer Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law, if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary and required to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on Site5.

"MacInstruct respects the privacy of the personal information you give us, such as your name, street address, telephone number and e-mail address, and other personal information you may provide. The following policy is intended to explain how we treat this information. This policy may change, so please check back from time to time.  **Traffic data**  Each time a visitor comes to a MacInstruct web site, our servers collect some basic technical information, including, for example, the visitor's domain name (i.e., the ISP from which the user is logged on). We use software to keep track of traffic to our sites and derive such information as the location from which the traffic originates and which particular pages within MacInstruct are being viewed and for how long. After we analyze this information, we discard it. We may aggregate information about visitors and traffic and may share the results with advertisers; generally, we will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data that you supply us without your permission. It will only be used to contact you in case you win a contest.  **Information Security and Quality**  We intend to protect the quality and integrity of your personally identifiable information. We have implemented appropriate technical and managerial procedures to maintain information that is accurate, current, and complete. We will make a sincere effort to respond to your requests to correct personal information inaccuracies in a timely manner.  **Newsletters and Other E-mail Features**  If you sign up to receive an e-mail newsletter from MacInstruct, such newsletters will be sent on a daily or weekly basis. You may also receive infrequent other announcements from MacInstruct. We will use your e-mail address for the distribution of these newsletters and announcements. Users can choose to unsubscribe from MacInstruct newsletters at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions found in each e-mail.  **Use of Cookies**  A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. MacInstruct does not generally make use of cookies, although it is possible that they may be used in a limited way to assist in the delivery of advertisements, to identify how many unique visitors there are to the MacInstruct site and to track usage. Other companies that place advertising on our site also have the ability to assign their cookies to you in a process that MacInstruct does not control.  In the event that MacInstruct starts to use Cookies more widely, they will never be used to track websites you visit other than MacInstruct. Some parties use cookies to view sites you visit other than their own, to assess your ""viewing habits."" MacInstruct will not subscribe to this practice.  **Contests**  MacInstruct may sponsor sweepstakes, contests or other events from time to time which require the collection, processing and storage of certain contact and demographic information (e.g., place of residence) for use as part of the contest. Sometimes these contests may be jointly-sponsored with companies. In that case the user's contact and other information will be shared with the other company only if it is expressly stated in the rules of the contest.  However, such contests will include the option to receive e-mail from our partners regarding their products or services. If you sign up for such an e-mail list, we will release your e-mail address to our partner for the purpose of such mailings, and only for that purpose. We will not release any of your other personal information to that partner. If you do not sign up for such an e-mail list, our partners will receive no information on you - including your e-mail address - even if you enter the associated contest or promotion.  **Surveys**  MacInstruct may conduct voluntary surveys of visitors to the site to collect certain demographic information about visitors to its site. This information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with advertisers and other third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific readers.  **Children's Privacy**  Protecting the privacy of young children is important to us. For that reason, MacInstruct will not collect or maintain information at its web site from those actually known to be under 13, and no part of MacInstruct is intentionally structured to attract anyone under 13\. The sole exception to this is our mailing lists. If a child under 13 signs up for our newsletter or any of our mailing lists, they will remain a member unless we are asked to remove them by their parent or legal guardian. All such requests should be directed to [matt@macinstruct.com](mailto:matt@macinstruct.com). **Other Disclosure of Personal Information**  MacInstruct will not otherwise disclose or make use of personal information without consent of the user except (i) as described in this privacy policy, or (ii) as required by law, court order or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority.

If our service providers or partners are based in a country outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we will inform you of the consequences of this circumstance in the description of the offer.  We currently use the following social media plug-ins: Facebook and LinkedIn. You can recognize the provider of the plug-in by the marking on the box above its initial letter or the logo. We offer you the possibility to communicate directly with the provider of the plug-in via the button. Only if you click on the marked field and thereby activate it, the plug-in provider receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding website of our online offer. In addition, the data specified in the section “General use of our portal” will be transmitted. In the case of Facebook, the IP address is anonymized immediately after collection, according to the respective provider in your country. By activating the plug-in, personal data is transferred from you to the respective plug-in provider and stored there (for US providers in the USA). Since the plug-in provider collects data mainly via cookies, we recommend that you delete all cookies before clicking on the grayed-out box using your browser's security settings.  We have no influence on the data collected and data processing processes, nor are we aware of the full extent of data collection, the purposes of processing, the storage periods. We also have no information on the deletion of the data collected by the plug-in provider. The plug-in provider stores the data collected about you as user profiles and uses these for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its website. Such an evaluation takes place in particular (also for not logged in users) for the representation of demand-fair advertisement and in order to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You have a right of objection to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact the respective plug-in provider to exercise this right. Through the plug-ins we offer you the possibility to interact with social networks and other users, so that we can improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user. The legal basis for the use of the plug-ins is Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR.  The data is passed on regardless of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider and are logged in there. If you are logged in with the plug-in provider, your data collected with us will be directly assigned to your existing account with the plug-in provider. If you click the activated button and, for example, link the page, the plug-in provider also stores this information in your user account and shares it publicly with your contacts. We recommend that you log out regularly after using a social network, especially before activating the button, as this way you can avoid being assigned to your profile with the plug-in provider.  Further information on the purpose and scope of data collection and its processing by the plug-in provider can be found in the data protection declarations of these providers notified below. They will also provide you with further information about your rights in this regard and setting options to protect your privacy.

Cookies are small data files that are transferred to your hard drive when you visit a website if your browser settings permit the acceptance of cookies. Cookies may enable us to recognize your computer, store your preferences and settings, enhance your user experience by delivering content specific to your interests, perform searches and analytics and assist with security administrative functions.. Similar technologies, such as web beacons or pixel tags function through the use of small files, such as a GIF or PNG, which are opened on a page, ad, or in an email. The request for these files from a server reveals certain information, such as your browser type, IP address, and other information. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information such as ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of the Digital Services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. We may also use these automated technologies to collect and analyze other non-personal information related to the devices you use to access the Digital Services, such as IP addresses, browser types, browser language, unique device identifiers and other information about your computer(s) and/or mobile device(s). Some tracking technologies on our Digital Services may be provided by a third party (which may be collecting information on its own behalf, or may be providing such information to us). Please note: some cookies/other technologies may track your activities not only on our Digital Services, but on third party sites you visit after you leave our Digital Services, and some services may aggregate this information collected from many sites into a single profile. To learn more about cookies and similar tracking technologies, and how they can affect your privacy, visit allaboutcookies.org.##Our Digital Services may use cookies or other technologies provided by website analytics services such as Google Analytics to help us better understand how our Digital Services are used. By tracking how and when you use our Digital Services, these technologies help us determine which features and content on our Digital Services are most important to our visitors. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you can turn off cookies using your browser’s settings menu; however, this may eliminate our ability to provide a personalized or user-friendly experience. To learn more about, or to opt-out of Google’s analytic and marketing services, visit Google Analytics Terms of Use, the Google Privacy Policy, or Google Analytics Opt-out.##Data about your activities online may be collected either by us, our affiliates, or third parties, for use in providing advertising tailored to your individual interests. We may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements across the internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party websites and viewing of ads and of our content. You may or may not be offered a choice as to whether or not to have your information collected for that purpose. The information collected may include information about your visits to our Digital Services, such as the pages you have viewed. These third-party tracking technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the effectiveness of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. This collection and ad targeting takes place both on our Digital Services and on third-party websites or services that participate in the ad network, such as websites that feature advertisements delivered by the ad network. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. The use of cookies, web beacons or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours, and we disclaim all liability in connection therewith. We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as a DoubleClick cookie) together to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Digital Services. To learn more about how to opt out of Google’s use of cookies, visit Google’s Ads Settings, here. To learn more about how to opt out of DoubleClick’s use of cookies, visit the DoubleClick opt-out page, here. To opt out from Facebook Custom Audience Pixel visit their customer support page here. To learn more about how to opt out of Twitter’s use of audience pixels, visit the Twitter help page here.##If you wish to take steps to opt-out of tracking by certain online advertisers, you can visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page at http://www.aboutads.info/choices or the Network Advertising Initiative at www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp. Please note, most modern browsers include a “do not track” feature that may help protect your privacy. However, because there is not yet a defined response to do-not-track requests, our Site does not respond to your browser’s do-not-track request.##Location tracking.##We may collect data from physical proximity beacons, RFID bracelets, or similar tracking technologies located in or near our venues or events, or (through partnerships with local businesses or entities) in other locations visited by users of our Digital Services. Proximity beacons emit radio signals and detect when a device enters a specific area. RFID bracelets (such as those worn by attendees at our festivals) each have a unique electromagnetic tag that can be read by a scanner. Through our use of RFID or beacon technologies, we may collect data about your location and other contextual data when you are near a beacon or when your RFID bracelet is scanned. Further, if your device preferences allow us or our Mobile App access to location services, we may collect information about the precise location of your device in or near our festivals, programs, and/or other events, including data from each of our or our partners’ beacons, wifi access points, or other location services with which you interact. This information may be collected when you are using one of our Mobile Apps and, periodically, in the background.##We typically use this information to send you relevant, targeted advertisements or offers (for example, a discount on food purchases near our event;) to analyze and improve our guests’ experience at our events; and to determine which events and services guests visit. We and any third parties enabling these features may store location data and combine it with other information we hold about you, including your customer profile. You may disable your mobile device’s communication with location services or proximity beacons by disabling the appropriate network interface (such as wifi or Bluetooth,) modifying your preferences for location services through your OS, or as otherwise described below.##Other sources of Personal Information or data.##If we receive Personal Information or data from you through our Digital Services other than as described in this Privacy Policy, it will still be used and managed in accordance with this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise stated at the time you provide the information.##Third party sites and services##As described above, our Digital Services include features, functionality, or offers (such as ticket purchases, promotions, surveys, etc.) provided by third parties, and may also contain links to third party advertisers and others. When you make purchases through third parties, we do not receive or store your payment account information, as the purchase and payment transaction is processed by the third party. However we may sometimes receive your email, or the last 4 digits of your credit card (for confirmation purposes), or other information provided during a purchase from the company through which your transaction was processed. We may also receive information from other third parties collecting information on our Digital Services, such as a third party promotion in which you choose to register. Any third party websites or services to which our Digital Services link may use cookies, independently collect data or solicit Personal Information, and you should carefully review the privacy policies of these third parties before providing them any Personal Information. This Policy does not apply to any information you submit to third-party websites or services, including, without limitation, any sites to which our Digital Services may redirect you for purchasing tickets, or other sites that may be connected to our Digital Services by hypertext link or otherwise.##With whom may we share your information?##Information we collect may be shared with a variety of parties, depending upon the purpose for and context in which that information was provided. We reserve the right to share your Personal Information with any of our current or future affiliated entities, subsidiaries, and parent companies. We may also share your Personal Information and other information with trusted third parties for marketing, advertising, or other commercial purposes, and we may occasionally allow third parties to access certain Digital Services for marketing purposes. In addition, if you purchase a ticket on our Digital Services or through links we provide, your Personal Information may be shared with trusted third parties in accordance with this Policy.##Please note, if you use any social media plugin, API, or other similar feature, use an event hashtag or similar link, or otherwise interact with us or our Digital Services via social media, anything you post may be made available on our Digital Services or to the general public. We may share, rebroadcast, or redisplay that information or other information derived from your social media interactions to the extent permitted by the terms of use governing the relevant social media service.##We may, without your consent, share Personal Information and other data with service providers who provide certain services on our behalf, or in the other circumstances noted below. For example, we may share certain Personal Information we collect with third parties such as providers of data hosting or processing services, payment processors, or other service providers. We also reserve the right to share any information we possess or data derived from it with service providers or others if such information has been reasonably de-identified.##In the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation or sale of all or a portion of our assets, customer data, including Personal Information, will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred, or may be disclosed (subject to confidentiality restrictions) during the due diligence process for a potential transaction.##In limited circumstances, we may, without your consent, access and disclose your Personal Information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you to the extent we believe such disclosure is required by law, regulation, rule or court order; pursuant to requests from governmental, regulatory or administrative agencies or law enforcement authorities; or to prevent, investigate, identify persons or organizations potentially involved in, or take any action regarding suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Use, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or we believe may expose us to legal liability. Additionally, we may disclose Personal Information in situations that we believe to be emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or property if we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat.##What choices do I have about the collection, use, and disclosure of my personal or other information?##It is possible for you to use some of our Digital Services without providing any Personal Information, but you may not be able to access certain features or view certain content. You may, to the extent such information is shared, opt out of having your information provided to third parties for marketing or other commercial purposes, and opt out of additional marketing or promotional communications from us. Please note, if you do not wish for us to provide certain information to one or more of our service providers, we may be unable to complete a transaction you request.##You can unsubscribe from all email newsletters or similar communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link in every email. You can instruct us not to provide your personal information to these third parties by sending an email to privacypolicy@aegworldwide.com with “REMOVE THIRD PARTIES” in the subject line. If you receive a communication from a third party and you do not wish to receive future communications from that party, you should also tell them to remove you from their marketing list.

"At Calvin College, we strive to respect the privacy of our website visitors because your privacy is important to us. This privacy statement describes what information we collect and how that information is protected and used.  ## Information Gathered Websites you visit may gather information about you. Sometimes you are asked to supply information such as your name, address or e-mail address. Other times processes built into the website gather information. We may ask you for information to answer a request that you have submitted to Calvin College. An example would be your name and address for mailing admissions or employment information. Information sent to Calvin College via web data entry may be read, filed, stored, forwarded, responded to or printed by Calvin College staff members for the purpose of answering and tracking your request. In some cases, the college may outsource the collection of information, such as with admissions or employment applications, and your information may be read, filed, stored, forwarded, responded to or printed by employees of a third-party vendor providing services under contract with the college. You may be asked to enter your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or other information on a Calvin College website. This information may be kept by the college and used for future communications. The college may release your personal information to third parties under provisions of [Calvin College's Policies and Procedures](http://www.calvin.edu/about/heoa.html). The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) governs student data and information, and usage of website information must comply with this law. ### Collection of Other Information Most information we gather does not identify you personally. We automatically collect information such as the type and identity of the Internet service provider you are using, your Internet protocol (IP) address, the time spent on the website, or the navigation path you took on the website. We use the gathered information to improve the navigation, flow and content of the website to provide you with the best possible information service. In some cases, faculty, students and staff or others using Calvin College web sites will be asked to provide user credentials including a user ID and password to access a service. In this case, your access to the related services may be personally identified. Some of Calvin’s website locations or third party partners may place online tracking technology such as a ""cookie"" in the browser files of a user's computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information, except when such information has been supplied by you. In addition, cookies placed in the browser files of a user’s computer by a third party may be used to collect web viewing data to personalize or customize the web experience. ### Special Disclosure Cases Calvin College may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Calvin College's rights or property, other Calvin College users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We reserve the right to use information to identify any visitors who refuse to comply with the [Calvin College CIT Policies and Agreements](http://www.calvin.edu/it/policies/) and to identify visitors who threaten or disrupt the service, site, customers or others. The college may disclose information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. ### E-Commerce Transactions Some of our website features may use applications to collect data to facilitate an e-commerce transaction. In this case we use third party services with an approved banking relationship to process credit card transactions. All credit card information is encrypted and only the information needed to complete a transaction history is stored on secure servers. ### Public Forums, Directories, Chat Rooms and Mail Lists This privacy statement does not protect you when you use Calvin College public forums. As a service to our users, Calvin College may offer directories, chat rooms, bulletin or message boards, or mailing list groups for website visitors. Any information shared in a directory, chat room, bulletin board, or other posting or online discussion is public information and may be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties that do not adhere to this privacy statement. ### Other Links The Calvin College website may contain destination links to other independently run websites for Calvin College student groups or organizations and to some third-party sites outside the ""calvin.edu"" domain. Calvin College is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such websites. These destination links are provided only for your convenience, and as such, you access them at your own risk. Any information you reveal on any such site is not subject to this privacy statement, therefore, you should consult the privacy policies of each site you visit.  However, we wish to ensure the integrity of our website and its destination links, so any comments pertaining to any sites accessed through destination links on our website are greatly appreciated. ### Security Calvin College treats your personal information as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. The website has information security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We restrict access to our data center and server rooms to authorized personnel and limit access to personal information to those employees who have a legitimate business need to access such information. Despite these security measures, we do not represent or warrant that personal information will be protected against loss, misuse or alteration by Calvin College or third parties. ### Privacy Statement Changes We may change this privacy statement at any time by posting revisions to our website. Your use of the website constitutes acceptance of the provisions of this privacy statement and your continued usage after such changes are posted constitutes acceptance of each revised privacy statement.

"####Privacy Policy##Scripps Media, Inc., and its affiliated websites (“us”, “we”, or “our”) provide online services, including, without limitation, websites, applications, platforms, and other electronic services (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy describes the treatment of information provided or collected through the Services where this Privacy Policy is posted. We have adopted this Privacy Policy to explain what information may be collected when you use the Services, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. ##Please read the following carefully to learn more about our Privacy Policy. Your use of this website indicates that you have read and accepted our privacy practices, as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In addition, please review our Terms of Use that governs your use of this website. ##You should also review this Privacy Policy frequently, as it may change from time to time without notice. We reserve the right to alter, modify, update, add to, subtract from or otherwise change this Privacy Policy at any time for any reason or no reason at all. We will post any changes here, and any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy. By continuing to use the website after a revised policy has been posted, you will be deemed to have agreed to such changes ##WHEN YOU ACCESS OUR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, OR TO ANY CHANGES WE MAY SUBSEQUENTLY MAKE, IMMEDIATELY STOP ACCESSING OUR SERVICES. ##If, at any point, we decide to use your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you of this change by e-mail to the last e-mail address provided to us. You will have a choice (by means of an “opt out” opportunity) as to whether we use the information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which your information was collected if you opt out of the new policy and no longer use the Services. ##A. INFORMATION WE COLLECT ##We typically collect two kinds of information about you through the Services: (a) information that you provide that personally identifies you; and (b) information that does not personally identify you, which we automatically collect when you visit our Services or that you provide us. ##(1) Information that you provide to us (Personally Identifiable Information): Our definition of personally identifiable information (“PII”) includes any information that may be used to specifically identify or contact you, such as your name, postal address, e-mail address and/or phone number. As a general policy, we do not automatically collect your personally identifiable information when you use the Services. In certain circumstances, we may request, allow or otherwise provide you an opportunity to submit your personally identifiable information in connection with a feature, program, promotion or some other aspect of the Services. For instance, you may: (a) provide your name, postal/shipping address, email address, credit card number and phone number when registering for a particular Service, using our online store, or in connection with a contest entry; (b) provide certain demographic information about yourself (e.g., age, gender, purchase preference, and usage frequency) when participating in a survey, poll or joining a club; or (c) post a general comment and/or recommendation using a Service. Certain information may not be personally identifiable when standing alone (e.g., your age), but may become so when combined with other information (e.g., your age and name). Whether or not you provide this information is your choice; however, in many instances this type of information is required to participate in the particular activity, realize a benefit we may offer, or gain access to certain content available on a Service. ##Furthermore, for social media, if you choose to log-in, access, or otherwise connect to or with the Services through a social networking service, we may collect your user ID and user name associated with that social networking service and information that you make public using that social networking service. We may also collect information that you have authorized any such service to share with us. ##In addition, you may have the opportunity to provide us with the PII, such as name or e-mail address, of a friend (or for a friend to provide such information about you), such as if you chose to e-mail a friend an article, electronic greeting card, trailer or other special feature from our website. We encourage you to send such items only to recipients who are your friends or family or persons with whom you have a relationship so that it doesn’t seem like we are “spamming” them. ##(2) Information Collected Automatically (Non-Personally Identifiable Information): Our definition of non-personally identifiable information is any information that does not personally identify you (“Non-PII”). Non-PII can include certain personally identifiable information that has been de-identified; that is, information that has been rendered anonymous. We obtain Non-PII about you from information that you provide us, either separately or together with your personally identifiable information. We also automatically collect certain Non-PII from you when you access any Service. This information can include, among other things, IP addresses, the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Safari), the third-party website from which your visit originated, the operating system you are using (e.g., Vista, Windows XP, or Mac OS), the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online or NetZero), the search terms you use on our Services, the specific web pages you visit, the duration of your visits, and location information. ##B. HOW WE USE & SHARE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED ##(1) Personally Identifiable Information: The personally identifiable information you submit to us is generally used to carry out your requests, respond to your inquiries, better serve you or provide information relevant to you, or in other ways naturally associated with the circumstances in which you provided the information. We may also use this information to later contact you for a variety of reasons, such as customer service, providing you promotional information for our products or those of our parent company, subsidiaries or other affiliated companies (“affiliated companies”), or to communicate with you about content or other information you have posted or shared with us via the Services. You may opt-out from receiving future promotional information from us or our affiliated companies, or direct that we not share your information with any affiliated companies, as set forth below. ##In certain instances, we may also share your personally identifiable information with our third party vendors performing functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our affiliated companies) – e.g., vendors that process credit card orders, deliver our merchandise, administer our promotions, provide us marketing or promotional assistance, analyze our data, and assist us with customer service. Our vendors agree to use this information, and we share information with them, only to carry out our requests. In addition, we may share your personally identifiable information with participating sponsors to a program or promotion (e.g., a sweepstakes or contest) you enter via any Service, and with third parties who assist us in using the content or other information you have posted or shared with us via any Service (e.g., production companies we may use). Further, we may share your personally identifiable information with third parties such as our co-promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, or as set forth when you submit the information, your personally identifiable information will not be shared or sold to any third parties without your prior approval. ##(2) Non-PII: We use Non-PII in a variety of ways, including to help analyze site traffic, understand customer needs and trends, carry out targeted promotional activities, and to improve our services. We may use your Non-PII by itself or aggregate it with information we have obtained from others. We may share your Non-PII with our affiliated companies and third parties to achieve these objectives and others, but remember that aggregate information is anonymous information that does not personally identify you. ##C. COOKIES AND PREFERENCE BASED ADVERTISING ##(1) Cookies and Web Beacons: We automatically receive and store certain types of Non-PII whenever you interact with us or the Services. For example, like many websites, we use “cookies,” “web beacons” (also called “clear gifs” or “pixel tags”), and local storage (e.g., “Flash cookies”) to obtain certain types of information when you access certain of our Services and communications. Third parties may collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Services. It is important to note that the cookies, Web beacons, and local storage objects that we use do not contain and are not tied to personally identifiable information about you. ##· “Cookies” are small files that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive or your web browser memory to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide convenience and other features to you. The types of cookies we use include session cookies and persistent cookies. ##· “Web beacons” are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and may be used to track the online movements of users, when an email has been opened, and to provide other information. ##· “Local storage” performs similar tasks as cookies, but can be stored in different parts of your computer or device and may be removed in a different manner than cookies. ##If you are concerned about the storage and use of cookies, you may be able to direct your internet browser to notify you and seek approval whenever a cookie is being sent to your web browser or hard drive. You may also delete a cookie manually from your hard drive through your internet browser or other programs. Click here (http://www.aboutads.info/consumers)  for more information on cookies and browser controls. Please note, however, that some parts of the Services will not function properly or be available to you if you refuse to accept a cookie or choose to disable the acceptance of cookies. ##(2) Preference Based Advertising: We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies,  click here (http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). If you do not wish to participate in this activity, please click here (http://optout.aboutads.info) and follow the simple opt-out process. ##A couple of important notes about this opt-out tool: (1) it includes all the advertising networks that we may work with, but also many that we do not work with; and (2) it relies on cookies to ensure that a given advertising network does not collect information about you (“Opt-out Cookies”). Therefore, if you use multiple computers or mobile devices, buy a new computer, change web browsers or delete these Opt-out Cookies from your computer, you will need to perform the opt-out task again. ##D. OTHER USES & INFORMATION ##(1) IP Addresses: An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet. It is not our practice to link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable; that is, the visitor’s session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us. However, we reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use or to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend our legal rights or property, the Services, or other users; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of the users of our Services or the general public. ##(2) Email Communications: If you send us an email with questions or comments, we may use your personally identifiable information to respond to your questions or comments, and we may save your questions or comments for future reference. For security reasons, we do not recommend that you send non-public personal information, such as passwords, social security numbers, or bank account information, to us by email. However, aside from our reply to such an email, it is not our standard practice to send you an email unless you request a particular service or sign up for a feature that involves email communications, it relates to purchases you have made with us (e.g., product updates or customer support), we are sending you information about our other products and services, or you consented to being contacted by email for a particular purpose. In certain instances, we may provide you with the option to set your preferences for receiving email communications from us; that is, agree to some communications but not others. You may “opt out” of receiving future commercial email communications from us by clicking the “unsubscribe” link included at the bottom of most emails we send, or as provided below; provided, however, we reserve the right to send you transactional emails such as customer service communications. ##(3) Transfer of Assets: As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets. If another entity acquires us or all (or substantially all) of our assets, the personally identifiable information and Non-PII we have about you will be transferred to and used by this acquiring entity, though we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your preferences are followed. Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties. ##(4) If you submit to Company a comment, photograph or other content to be published by Company (either online or offline), we may publish your name or other PII in connection with publishing the content. ##(5) Other: Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable information or Non-PII about you if we are required to do so by law, with respect to copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims, or if we believe that such action is necessary to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend our legal rights or property, our Services, or other users; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of the users of our Services or the general public. ##(5) Your California Privacy Rights: ##· Residents of the State of California, under Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed certain personally identifiable information as defined under California law during the preceding year for third party direct marketing purposes. You are limited to one request per calendar year. In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. You may request the information via e-mail to the address set forth in Section J. ##California Civil Code permits California residents to request that Company not share your personally identifiable information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to the address set forth in Section J. You must include this website as the subject line, and your full name, e-mail address, and postal address in your message. ##· If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user of any site where this Privacy Policy is posted, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to request and obtain removal of content that you have publicly posted. To make such a request, please send an e-mail with a detailed description of the specific content to the address set forth in Section J. Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information that you have posted and there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal even if requested. ##(6) Online Tracking: The Services do not respond to Do Not Track signals, as there is currently no industry standard for such signals. We enable you to control how your information is collected through other practices described in this Privacy Policy. ##E. PUBLIC FORUMS ##We may offer chat rooms, blogs, message boards, bulletin boards, or similar public forums where you and other users of our Services can communicate. The protections described in this Privacy Policy do not apply when you provide information (including personal information) in connection with your use of these public forums. We may use your personally identifiable information and Non-PII to identify you with a posting in a public forum. Any information you share in a public forum is public information and may be seen or collected by anyone, including third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for events arising from the distribution of any information you choose to publicly post or share through our Services. ##F. CHILDREN ##The Services requiring the submission of personally identifiable information are not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 from the Services related to this Privacy Policy. If you are under thirteen (13) years of age, do not send any information about yourself to Company. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed personally identifiable information to us please contact us at as provided in Section J. A parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 may review and request deletion of such child’s personally identifiable information as well as prohibit the use thereof. ##G. KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE ##We have implemented security measures we consider reasonable and appropriate to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and are not responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information. In the unfortunate event that your “personally identifiable information” (as the term or similar terms are defined by any applicable law requiring notice upon a security breach) is compromised, we may notify you by e-mail (at our sole and absolute discretion) to the last e-mail address you have provided us in the most expedient time reasonable under the circumstances; provided, however, delays in notification may occur while we take necessary measures to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable integrity to the system as well as for the legitimate needs of law enforcement if notification would impede a criminal investigation. From time to time we evaluate new technology for protecting information, and when appropriate, we upgrade our information security systems. ##H. OTHER SITES/LINKS ##Our Services may link to or contain links to other third-party websites that we do not control or maintain, such as in connection with purchasing products referenced on our Services and banner advertisements. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any third-party website. We encourage you to note when you leave our Services and to read the privacy statements of all third-party websites before submitting any personally identifiable information. ##I. INTERNATIONAL USERS ##The Services are hosted in the United States and are directed toward users who reside in the United States. By using the Services, your personal information may be collected, stored, processed, or transferred in and to the United States where our servers are located and our databases are operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries where your personal information may be collected, stored, or processed might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By using the Services, you consent to your information being transferred to and stored or processed in our facilities and the facilities of third parties described in this Privacy Policy. ##J. CONTACT & OPT-OUT INFORMATION ##You may contact us via support form - http://support.katc.com/support/tickets/new  if: (a) you have questions or comments about our Privacy Policy; (b) wish to make corrections to any personally identifiable information you have provided; (c) want to opt-out from receiving future commercial correspondence, including emails, from us or our affiliated companies; or (d) wish to withdraw your consent to sharing your personally identifiable information with others. ##We will respond to your request and, if applicable and appropriate, make the requested change in our active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that we may not be able to fulfill certain requests while allowing you access to certain benefits and features of our Services. ##K. SOLE STATEMENT ##This Privacy Policy is the sole statement of our privacy policy with respect to our Services, and no summary, modification, restatement or other version thereof, or other privacy statement or policy, in any form, is valid unless we post a new or revised Privacy Policy on the Services.

"This PRIVACY POLICY (this ""Policy"") relates to the use of this website, TAZINGA™.COM, (the ""Site"") and is applicable to all information collected about you through the Site. We (""we"", ""us"" or ""our"") disclose the information collection and usage practices applicable to the Site in this Policy. This Policy describes the types of information that we collect from you on this Site and the other people who may also visit the Site (the ""Users"") and how we may use that information. By providing any information, you agree to our use of that information consistent with this Policy. Please read this Policy carefully before providing us with any information. If you have questions about this Policy, e-mail us at [Contact Us](mailto:%69%6e%66%6f@%74%61%7a%69%6e%67%61.%63%6f%6d). ## How We Handle Information We log your Internet Protocol (""IP"") address in order to help us to diagnose problems with our server, administer the Site and track usage statistics. Your IP address may vary each time you visit, or it may be the same, depending on whether you access the Site through an always-on type of Internet connection (such as cable or DSL), or through a dial-up connection. Either way, it would be very difficult for us to personally identify you through your IP address. If you reached the Site by clicking on a link or ad from another website, then we may also log that information. This helps us to maximize our Internet exposure and to understand the interests of our Users. All of this information is collected and used only in aggregated form; that is, it is entered into our database, where we can use it to generate overall anonymous reports on our Users. In addition, we will share your IP address, along with any search term used by you while conducting a query, with our advertising partners. This information will not be linked with any personal information. ## Cookies We may place a small file known as a ""cookie"" on your computer's hard drive. A cookie may contain information that allows us to track your path through the Site and to determine whether you have visited us before. However, the cookies will not contain any information that would allow us to personally identify you. Our cookies cannot be used to read data from your hard drive and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created by other websites. We use cookies in this manner to help us understand how Users use the Site, and to help us to improve the Site. You may refuse to accept a cookie from us by following the procedures for rejecting cookies specific to your web browser. Although you may do so, you may find that some aspects of the Site may not function properly without cookies.  ## Clear GIFs We also employ a software technology called ""clear gifs,"" which helps us better manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on websites and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.  If you visit this Site by ""clicking through"" from another website, and you have registered with that other website, then certain information about you that you provided to that other website, such as the terms you were searching on that led you to the Site, may be transmitted to us and we may use it. You should carefully review the privacy policy of any website from which you reached the Site in order to determine what information was collected by that website and for what purpose(s) you agreed that website could use that information. We may or may not retain that information; if we do, then we will only use it in accordance with this Policy. ## Policy Regarding Children Under the Age of 18 The Site is not intended for children under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect or use any information from children under the age of 18. ## How We Use the Information We Collect We may use the information that you provide to us to, among other things:  * Make your next visit to the Site more personalized.  * Compile anonymous statistical information and analysis.  * Provide compiled anonymous information to third parties.  * Provide, sell or rent your information to third parties for advertising purposes. ## Consent to the Use of Third Party Providers Please understand that we may contract with other third parties to provide various services relating to the Site on an outsourced basis rather than performing the services ourselves. For example, we may contract with a website hosting provider to host the Site for us. By visiting the Site, all Users consent to us providing all information (whether or not personally identifiable) received or collected from those Users to such third party providers for the purpose of enabling the third party provider to provide these outsourced services to us. In addition, all Users consent to the collection, maintenance, and processing of their information (whether or not personally identifiable) by us and these third party providers. We may also contract with other third party companies to collect data relating to our website for the purpose of reporting website traffic, statistics, advertising 'click-throughs', and/or other activities on our website. Where permitted by us, such companies may also use cookies or other monitoring technologies to collect this data about our website visitors. All collected data is anonymous except where agreed to in advance by the individual website user. Data collected by such companies in accordance with this Policy may also be made available to the company's third party service providers.  ## Opting Out This Policy describes our potential uses of your information. If you do not agree to our potential uses of your information as we have described for you in this Policy, you are not required to provide that information to us and you may opt out from any further access or use of the Site.  ## Other Websites and Links Please be aware that our promotional partners, advertisers, sponsors, and other third-party websites accessible through the Site may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. We are not responsible or liable for any actions, content of websites or privacy policies of such third parties. You should review the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing any information (whether or not personally identifiable information) through linked websites. ## Disclosure of Your Information As you might expect, we must cooperate with legal authorities, and may in some circumstances be required to disclose the information you provided (whether or not personally identifiable information) in response to requests from law enforcement authorities, or in response to a subpoena or other legal process. We don't expect this to happen, but if it does, we will provide only the information required. We can also turn over information about you if we believe we must in order to prevent a violation of the law, and by accepting this Policy, you consent to our right to do so, in our sole discretion. You also consent to our disclosing information about you in the course of legal proceedings if we believe we are legally required to do so, if we reasonably believe that doing so may mitigate our liability, or if doing so will assist us in enforcing our legal rights. At some point we may establish subsidiaries, divisions, or other related companies. When that happens, then we may disclose your information to those related companies, in which case we will request those related companies to abide by this Policy or their own company policy, if appropriate and applicable. We may also disclose some information to a potential acquirer, although such disclosure would be subject to normal and customary confidentiality requirements. ## Notice If we change this Policy, we will post the amended Policy on the Site so that you are aware of any changes or additions that have been made relating to what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time, so please visit and review the Site frequently for any changes or modifications. Any such changes or amendments to this Policy will be effective when posted on the Site. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted, the revised Policy by your continued access and use of our services or the Site. ## Security Of course, we will take reasonable measures to secure the information Users provide to us, using industry-standard methods. All information is protected by password and accessible only to authorized User personnel. However, there is a remote possibility that Internet transmissions containing a User's personally identifiable information, if provided, may be intercepted by others. There is no way for us to ensure the total and complete privacy of User information before it arrives at the Site or after it leaves the Site. Accordingly, we do not undertake any responsibility or liability for such events. If you have questions specifically about this Policy, or to issues pertaining to the practices of the Site or your use of the Site, please contact us. ## Contact Information E-mail: [Contact Us](mailto:%69%6e%66%6f@%74%61%7a%69%6e%67%61.%63%6f%6d) Effective Date: 12/01/08 Copyright © 2008-2014 Tazinga.

PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE PICSART SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN AND ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. THIS PRIVACY POLICY IS PART OF AND INCORPORATED INTO PICSART'S [TERMS OF USE](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions) ( **""Terms of Use""** ). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH BELOW, YOU MAY NOT USE THE PICSART SERVICE.  For more information on Interest-based Advertising and your choices regarding it, click here.  This Privacy Policy applies to information (including personal information) collected through the PicsArt Service.  ## THE WHAT & HOW OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT  We collect information that you voluntarily provide to us. For example, we collect your name, email address, username, social network information and other information you provide us when you register, set up an account, contact us by e-mail or use our services. We may also obtain information from other companies and combine that with information we collect on the PicsArt Service; for example, when you link your account with Facebook, we might have access to your name. We may collect information about you from other Users if they share any Content with you, send a message, image and online contact information.  When you visit the Site, we automatically collect some information. For example, it is standard for your Web browser to automatically send information to every Web site you visit, including ours. Such information includes your computer's Internet Protocol (""IP"") address, access times, browser type and language, and referring Web site addresses. We also collect and combine information about devices you use to access PicsArt Services, and information about your usage and activity on the Site.  With your permission (on download or in the app), we may access and store your device's contact list to find your friends on the PicsArt Service, to invite them, or to share your Content with them. We may also collect information about others if you use the PicsArt Service to upload, share and/or distribute Content that contains information about them, including their name, image, and online contact information.  Cookies We automatically collect certain information through the use of ""cookies"". Cookies are small data files that are stored on your hard drive by a Web site. Among other things, the use of cookies helps us to improve the Site and your experience on the Site. We use cookies to see which areas and features of the Site are most popular, to count the number of computers accessing the Site, to personalize your experience and to remember your preferences. If your browser is set not to accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you may not be able to access certain features or services of the Site.  Content and Metadata We also collect and retain your metadata along with your Content. For example, your images may be accompanied by additional Content such as a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords), comments, or may include metadata like a geotag. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using others' APIs then your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and may be searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.  ## STORAGE OF INFORMATION & TRANSFER OF DATA  If you are using the PicsArt Service from a country other than the country in which our Web servers are located (currently the United States of America) the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries.  ## HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION  We use information collected through the PicsArt Service:   * to communicate with you or third parties;   * to process your requests and transactions;   * to provide and improve the PicsArt Service;   * to customize the services and/or products we provide to you;   * to assist with our product and service development;   * to perform marketing activities;   * to provide relevant advertising;   * for other purposes related to our business;   * to protect the security of our interests, including our premises, assets, and systems;   * to comply with the law; or   * as otherwise disclosed at the time personal information is collected.  ## WITH WHOM WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION  Information collected through the PicsArt Service may be shared with companies and organizations that perform services on our behalf (for example, companies that provide data management or other support services to us such as data storage and Web hosting services). We may share your information with third parties to serve you relevant advertising and market our products.  Also, we may disclose the information we collect through the PicsArt Service when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate:   * to comply with applicable law (e.g., in response to a valid court order or subpoena);   * to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft;   * to enforce the Terms of Use or other agreements that govern your use of the PicsArt Service and/or our services;   * pursuant to a subpoena, court order, governmental inquiry, or other legal process or as otherwise required by law, or to protect our rights or the rights of third parties;   * with your consent or as otherwise disclosed at the time of data collection or sharing; or   * to protect the rights, property, vital interests, or safety of us, our users or others.  We share information that has been de-identified or aggregated without restriction.  We may disclose your information without giving you prior notice if we believe it is necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person. Nothing in this privacy policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you might have to efforts by third parties to compel disclosure of your information, including legal orders from the government.  Your information and other data collected by us may be transferred to another company that has acquired our stock or assets, for example, as a result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation.  ## HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION  The retention period of collected information depends on the type of information and the reasons why we collect it. In case the retention of your information is extended for a longer period for reasons we define below, we encrypt (anonymize) it to ensure it does not directly identify you. Such data is further retained until complete deletion becomes possible.  Your account information is retained while your account is active, unless you request us to delete it or remove your account. In case you deactivate/delete your account or request us to delete your information, some information may still be retained for a reasonable time to enhance your re-activation in case you decide to return to our services. We may also retain some information we believe in good faith is necessary for legal and regulatory compliance, research and development, business matters, and improvement of our Services.  In cases when you delete your information or request us to delete it, some of your information you shared through the Services may still be accessible for those with whom you shared it. For example, if you shared an image through PicsArt Services, this image may still be visible for those with whom you shared, even if we delete it from your account.  ## CONTROLLING AND MODIFYING YOUR INFORMATION - OPT-OUT / OPT-IN  We respect your right to control and make choices about your information. You may request PicsArt to:   * provide you with information we collect about you;   * transfer your information to another controller of your choice, when technically feasible;   * delete (please see below for more details on deletion);   * update, edit or modify your information; or   * change your privacy preferences at any time.

If you are a Nevada or California resident, please see the “Nevada Privacy Rights” or “California Privacy Rights” sections, respectively, for state-specific information.  We believe that you proceed to use our PicsArt Services upon accepting all the terms in our Terms of Use, which incorporate also the terms of this Privacy Policy. And as such we have your consent in processing and using your data as defined above. However, you are also free to choose to withdraw your consent and request us to cease processing your information by sending us a notice. In such case your withdrawal will not affect the legitimacy of the prior data processing.  You may also opt out of receiving promotional communications from us, including, but not limited to, promotional emails, by emailing us at [privacy@picsart.com](mailto:privacy@picsart.com). Transactional service communications (such as messages about your registration) are not subject to the foregoing opt-out procedures, as are necessary for the regular conduct of our business records. Requests to disable your account or reset your password should be sent to [support@picsart.com](mailto:support@picsart.com) for faster processing.  ## DIGITAL ADVERTISING & ANALYTICS  We may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers (“Advertising Providers”) that serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated platforms. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your use of the Site and other sites or apps over time, including information about relationships among different browsers and devices. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising.  PicsArt adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles in connection with this interest-based advertising activity. You may visit the DAA Webchoices tool at www.aboutads.info to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt out of this advertising on websites by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program. If you delete your cookies or use a different browser or mobile device, you may need to renew your opt-out choices exercised through the DAA Webchoices tool. Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. Additionally, your browser may offer tools to limit the use of cookies or to delete cookies; however, if you use these tools, our Site may not function as intended.  We may also work with third parties that collect data about your use of the Site and other sites or apps over time for non-advertising purposes. PicsArt uses Google Analytics and other third-party services to improve the performance of the Site and for analytics and marketing purposes.

To this end we have incorporated security measures into our system to protect you and PicsArt from any data breach. Such measures include encryption of your data while in transfer, regular revision of security procedures and compliance in the system, restricted number of employees under strict confidentiality obligations that are authorized to access your information for the purposes of legitimate processing and handling, as described above. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security measures. If you use a password on the PicsArt Service, you are responsible for keeping it confidential. Do not share it with any other person. If you believe your password has been misused or your account compromised, please advise us immediately by sending a notice at [privacy@picsart.com](mailto:privacy@picsart.com).  ## CHILDREN UNDER 13  THE PICSART SERVICES ARE NOT MEANT FOR PEOPLE UNDER 13. We are committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and we do not target the PicsArt Service to children under 13. If we receive a valid notice through [privacy@picsart.com](mailto:privacy@picsart.com) that a minor under age of 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take measures to delete it as soon as possible.  ## CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS  If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information (if any) by PicsArt to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. To make this request, please email [privacy@picsart.com](mailto:privacy@picsart.com) or contact us using this address: PicsArt, Inc., Attn: Legal, One Market, Floor 32, San Francisco, CA 93105.

Privacy and safety issues are important to us.##Question regarding our policies##Questions regarding our policies should be directed to our web editor by e-mail at webeditor@kansan.com, or by phone at (785) 864-4810, or by postal mail at: Kansan.com ATTN: Privacy Policy Coordinator 119 Stauffer-Flint Hall, Lawrence, KS 66045.##The Internet, Privacy, and Kansan.com##The Internet contains a wealth of information; unfortunately, it may also contain personal details about you that you don't want everyone to know. For example, your real name (lots of people on the Internet use aliases, alter egos or nicknames), street address, phone number, or e-mail addresses. When you go online, sites you visit may be gathering information about you without your knowledge. At Kansan.com we strive to help our customers protect their privacy while using our services.##Kansan.com's Privacy Policy##Kansan.com's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Using the Internet should be a fun experience and we want to help you make it so.##The information you provide for your personal Kansan.com account will not be disclosed to third parties without your consent. Kansan.com may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Kansan.com's rights or property, other Kansan.com users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Kansan.com may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.##Kansan.com shares aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we will say Kansan.com's audience is x percent females and y percent males. This data is used to customize Kansan.com content and advertising to deliver a better experience for our users.##There are cases where Kansan.com may ask you for personal information such as your name, e-mail address, and birth date. For example, we request personal information when you register for a Kansan.com account or for services that require registration or subscription. Kansan.com needs to collect this information for fulfilling prizes, tracking/verifying compliance with Kansan.com policies as well as federal, state and local laws and/or for editorial and feedback solicitation purposes.##In case you change your mind or some personal information may change (such as your zip code), we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. You can do this by contacting us via e-mail at info@kansan.com.##Opting-Out##Information provided at the time of registration or submission from a guest who is 18 years of age or over may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by Kansan.com and our affiliates or companies that have been prescreened by Kansan.com. To keep you in control of your personal information and the communications directed to you, we allow you to opt-out of the following services: sharing your information in our member directory, receiving communications from Kansan.com about new features or services, and receiving communications about offers from third-party companies that offer a product or service that we think would be of value to you. If a guest objects to such use for any reason, he/she may stop that use -- by e-mail request to info@kansan.com. ##Information provided when purchasing products from any of our online stores may be used for marketing and promotional purposes and is subject to the opt-out processes described on, or linked to, each order form.##Policies for Kids and Teens (Individuals Under 18 years of Age)##Kansan.com encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on the sites. No information should be submitted to or posted at Kansan.com by guests under 17 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. ##Guests under 18 years of age may not participate in any contests or promotions offered by Kansan.com sites.##Use of IP Address##An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that ""serve up"" Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. ##Kansan.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When guests request pages from Kansan.com sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others. ##Some services within Kansan.com, such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message. Please review each service prior to use and only use those that disclose information you are comfortable with sharing. ##Use of Cookies##What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you're at our site. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them at most major Web sites. Navigating the Kansan.com website requires the use of cookies to maintain information about what page you are on. You may experience problems using our website if you disable cookie support.##By showing how and when guests use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our users needs.##You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. Kansan.com does not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. Only cookies provided by our website are required for proper navigation of Kansan.com##Links to Other Sites##Users should be aware that when you are on Kansan.com, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from Kansan.com pages that take you outside our service. For example, if you ""click"" on a banner advertisement or an Kansan.com search result, the ""click"" takes you off the Kansan.com site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use Kansan.com's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information.##Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online --- for example, via message boards or chat --- that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While Kansan.com strives to protect its user's personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk.##Kansan.com's policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Kansan.com's control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.##Security##The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Kansan.com can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. When and/or if credit card information is transmitted we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.##Your Acceptance of These Terms##By using this site, you signify your assent to the Kansan.com Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites. Your continued use of the Kansan.com sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.##Last Updated 8/27/2003","Kansan.com is committed to providing the best online campus experience within a trusted environment.

We want to make your experience on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the Internet’s vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence.##We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company collects information from all end users of our Internet services (the “Services”)-those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts (“Visitors”) as well as those who may purchase Products and/or pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service (“Members”)-what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of such information. We request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.##Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used##Introduction.##Our company collects information in different ways from Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services and the network of Web sites accessible through our Service.##Registration: Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Products or Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member’s account (such as for billing purposes). This information may be shared with third parties, as stated herein, or in special circumstances.##However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote our Services, we may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the purpose of offering you other products and services.##In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.##Also, with purchases, we supply our member’s contact information, to our business partners, who then may contact the member by telephone after the member purchase. Sales proceeds are collected by the that business partner company. We also may supply other companies with contact information, for mail offers we believe would be of interest to our members, with or without compensation from those companies. At times we may send an advertisement for a third party product, where we collect the sales proceeds, and forward the purchaser’s information to that third party.##Our Company Partners and Sponsors: Some products and services may be offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate, independent contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and Members some of these products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal information.##Online Shopping: At some Web sites, you can purchase products and services or register to receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card information.##If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the recipient’s name, address, and phone number. Our company has no control over the third parties’ use of any personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so.##If you order services or products directly from our company, we use the personal information you provide to process that order. We do share this information with outside parties that we do business with.##Online Advertisements: Our company may display our online advertisements. In those cases we share information about our Visitors and Members collected through the registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers.##Additionally, in some instances, we use this information to deliver tailored advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the information we have collected, we may then display or send the advertisement to the intended audience. Our company does share personal information about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers or joint venture companies.##Responses to Email Inquiries: When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to our company, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive.##Voluntary Customer Surveys: We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of products and services we offer and how we provide them to you.##We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we may have, to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information).

"Our privacy policy provides information on how we collect, use, share and protect information of our members and visitors when they use our site. By becoming a member of our community, you are agreeing to our policies, rules, as well as our terms of services. ## Information We do our best to protect the information of our members. You can manage information that is visible to the public by clicking on your profile settings and selecting choice information that should be made public.  The nature of information we collect is also dependent on how you use our services. You can either be a Guest User or a Registered User. A Guest User has limited access, and can only go through topics without being able to join in the conversation. A Registered User however has full license to participate in conversations and also the ability to share topics from our site to their various social media pages. ## Notifications Part of the reasons why we collect information such as email address, is to notify users about a new topic, or their involvement in a conversation. If a user responds to the topic started by a user, or mentions them in a post, a notification will be sent via email informing them of their involvement in a new or existing topic. Some people may view the notifications as being intrusive depending on how often they are involved in a conversation. Users can however change notification settings from their profiles and choose whether or not to receive these notifications. ## Being Anonymous The fact that you can send messages without other people knowing your true identity is what makes Zegist unique. We understand that some people better express themselves when they are not known. So Zegist has provided that avenue for people to join conversations on the basis of being anonymous. Note that if you are a Registered User and you participate in a conversation anonymously, our Service will still have a record of the fact that you are the person behind the anonymous account, even if we keep this private. However, if someone abuses the option of being anonymous by making offensive comments and insulting words because they know people don’t know who they are, you have the ability to report that user to us so that we will take appropriate action. We have also built in site moderation techniques to protect you and to prevent users from transmitting harmful content. ## Online Analytics For better understanding of the way you use our services, we may use third-party web analytics, particularly Google Analytics. This is to help us monitor traffic on our site. The information collected by this technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate Zegist users’ use of the services. To prevent Google  Analytics from collecting or using your information, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on. ## Plagiarism We do not claim ownership of any of the images or stories put up on our site. To avoid copyright and plagiarism issues, we advise every member of the community to give credit to the owners of every form of intellectual property they use.  ## Language We are very diverse and are particular about every of our members. We advise that members refrain from making comments that are offensive, defamatory and slanderous.

So please check this page periodically to get updates on any changes. ## Contact Us Feel free to send us a message [@Zegist](https://web.archive.org/users/zegist) regarding any issue and we will respond appropriately as soon as possible.","By becoming a member of our community, you are agreeing to our policies, rules, as well as our terms of services.

"CallingMumbai.com and its affiliates take online privacy seriously. Any data that we collect as a result of your use of the site remains confidential, unless you or we explicitly state otherwise. Like virtually all web sites, we collect information about our visitors and how they use this site. Most of this data is used for general informational purposes and we make no effort whatever to individually or personally identify you or your use of the site, except where we have your explicit approval. The data we do collect are used primarily for three purposes:   * to analyze our traffic and usage patterns   * to target advertisements   * to personalize our site for individuals or groups of users The following paragraphs describe further how we collect user data and what we do with it. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us. ### Log Files On our site, as on most all sites, our computers keep a record of your activity on the site in something called a _log file_. Most log files, including ours, contain basic information like what pages were viewed for how long in what sequence and at what time. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We make no effort to identify individual IP addresses or to associate logged click streams with individual users. When we share log file information with our advertisers, partners, or anyone else, we do so only in the aggregate and not in way that would allow identification of individual users. For example, we might provide something that says: ""Our average user visits 3x per year and views 5 pages per visit."" ### Cookies A 'cookie' is a small file that a web site stores on your computer to help keep things organized. Like most all websites, we use cookies to allow you to customize certain aspects of the site and to allow us to keep track of who is doing what on our site. Our cookies contain small bits of information that allow our computers to say, for instance, ""this person has visited us 3 times before"" or ""this person told us they like to see temperatures in Celsius, not Fahrenheit."" Among many other things, they also help us determine which sections of our site are the most popular, which sections are not, and which sections seem hardest for people to use. To protect your privacy, we use minimalist cookies that track only essential information that helps deliver a better experience to you. We do not use cookies to gather demographic information about you (unless you explicitly provide it to us). And we take steps to ensure that our cookies contain no malicious code that could harm your computer. ### Cookies & Advertising We contract with reputable advertising vendors to serve advertisements on our site. In the course of delivering these ads, these vendors may also create and store their own cookies on your computer. Generally speaking, these cookies are intended to help these firms present more relevant advertising to you. While we make an effort to do business with reputable vendors, ultimately we have no control over these independent companies, the cookies they employ, or the manner in which they use information obtained through them. If you are uncomfortable about accepting cookies from us or from our advertising vendors, you may adjust the settings in your browser to reject these cookies. Please note that doing so may limit some aspects of your experience at CallingMumbai.com. However, for the most part, the site will continue to work and you will experience most all the functionality that we offer. ### User Submitted Information In certain situations, CallingMumbai.com receives information voluntarily from you while you are using the site. For instance, we receive information from you when you register for the site, leave a comment on one of our pages, vote in one of our polls, or participate in a special offer. When we receive such personal information, we store it either on our servers, in the cookie we maintain on your computer, or both. We will treat any information you provide us with utmost care to protect your individual privacy, consistent with the terms under which the information was received. As a general rule, we will not use your information internally in a way that compromises your privacy, nor will we share it with business partners, advertisers, or others in such a fashion. However, please be aware that in some cases we do solicit information for marketing or other purposes where usage of your information may differ from our general practices. For instance, a special promotional offer conducted in collaboration with a business partner that requires that business partner to receive your email address or other information. All such situations will be clearly labeled and will give you ample opportunity to decline participation or, in some cases, to opt-out of or limit how you participate. For this reason, we recommend that you be attentive to these special situations and ensure that you are providing your information on an informed basis. ### Special Offers We may periodically send out updates about new features, special offers from partners or advertisers, or other information we believe our users might find relevant. Individuals who have provided us with their email address will receive these offers unless they have _opted-out_. Generally, it is easy to opt-out either at the time of initial registration (normally there is a check-box to opt-out) or you can do so through a link in the offer email itself. If you are having continuing problems, please email us and we will resolve the issue. ### Security In partnership with our hosting provider, this website takes extensive precautions to protect your information as well as the website itself from unauthorized access and use. This includes a full compliment of electronic security measures (such as firewalls and anti-virus programs) as well as physical security measures (such biometric door locks) to keep intruders away from equipment and documentation. ### Links to Other Websites While this website contains links to many other websites, please be aware that CallingMumbai.com has not reviewed and is not responsible for the privacy practices of any of these sites. This privacy statement applies solely to this site and makes no representation whatsoever about the practices of any other site. To make it easier to see when you've left our site, we have tried to make external links automatically open in a new browser window or tab. However, we cannot guarantee this will happen and you should be mindful of when you are no longer on CallingMumbai.com. At such time, we recommend you review the privacy policies of those sites and take appropriate steps to protect your privacy.

We are registered as a controller with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) under registration number Z1995728. You can confirm our registration here: www.ico.org.uk##WHAT WE DON’T DO WITH YOUR DATA##Before confirming what data we collect, and why, here’s what we definitely don’t do with your data, unless clearly set out in this notice.##• We don’t share it with anyone else.##• We don’t use it for any purpose (including retargeting, commingling across multiple advertisers’ campaigns or allowing piggybacking or redirecting with tags), except on an aggregate and anonymous basis, and only to assess the performance and effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.##• We don't use it to build, append to, edit, influence or augment user profiles, including profiles associated with any mobile device identifier or other unique identifiers that identify any particular user, browser, computer or device.##• We don’t transfer it (including any anonymous, aggregate or derived data) to any advertising network, advert exchange, data broker, or other advertising or monetisation-related service.##WHAT DATA WE COLLECT, AND HOW##If you register to use our site (as described above), our webform will ask you for your first and last names, and email address. It will also ask you for a password, which you will need whenever you access your Account.##Once you’ve registered to use our site, you can provide us with further information in the profile section of your Account.

It will always be clear from the webform and profile section what information we’re requesting.##For us to pay you for Earning Opportunities that you have completed, you need a Paypal account. We will ask you to confirm your Paypal account by logging into your account through our site. When you do this, Paypal will confirm your email address, country, and post code. We do not use this information for any other purpose, only to confirm your Paypal account. ##We also store and share Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, as explained below. Every computer or device has an IP address – a unique number – which enables it to communicate with other computers and devices over the Internet. ##Additionally, we might collect data about you if you contact us, or we contact you, by email, telephone or post. ##HOW WE USE YOUR DATA##We use your data (described above) in the following ways.##To enable you to access your Account, and view and participate in Earning Opportunities##As explained above, you will need your email address and password each time you access your Account. This is to ensure that your Account remains secure.##All available Earning Opportunities will be shown in your Account dashboard.##If you choose to provide us with further information in the profile section of your Account, we may use this additional information to find and show you Earning Opportunities that are most relevant to you and your profile.##If you expressly select an Earning Opportunity, you will be taken to the Service Provider’s website to participate in the same. Please note that the Service Provider’s own privacy and cookies notices and terms of use will apply. Please read these carefully.##We store IP addresses so that we know which country you’re based in, and we can therefore show you our site in your local language.##To create custom and lookalike/similar audiences##We like to work with Facebook, Google and other platforms (“ Platforms ”) to reach out to you with adverts. We also like to use Platforms to reach out to other people who might like to use our site.##We do this in two ways. In both cases, your data, along with other data, is used to create a custom audience and/or a lookalike/similar audience. Whenever an audience is shared with a Platform, the data is first hashed and pseudonymised, meaning that any data within the audience that could identify a person is replaced with an artificial identifier. So, the process is secure. Also, we don’t share more data than we need to for the purpose of creating the audience.##• Custom audience – A custom audience is a list of existing members of our site (“ Existing Members ”). From time to time, we share this with Platforms. As explained above, the data is first hashed and pseudonymised. The Platform uses this audience to show our Existing Members our adverts.##• Lookalike/similar audience – A lookalike/similar audience is an audience created by the Platform. From time to time, we share with Platforms a list of Existing Members. The Platform uses this list to find and create lookalikes – i.e. other Platform users who have similar characteristics to the Existing Members – to which it shows our adverts. Again, as explained above, the data is first hashed and pseudonymised.##As we explain below, at any time, you may object to such activity by emailing us at dataprotection@mvfglobal.com.##Working with suppliers##We work with a number of suppliers, who process data on our behalf. These include cloud storage providers and email service providers. We have appropriate contracts in place with such suppliers to ensure the protection and confidentiality of data.##COOKIES##Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. At the bottom of this policy, we have included a table, setting out what cookies we use, and the purposes for which we use them.##Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit http://www.aboutcookies.org or http://www.allaboutcookies.org.##To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites visit http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.##TRANSFERRING YOUR DATA##We may transfer your data outside the European Economic Area (the “EEA“).##Some of those countries (e.g. Canada, USA) have a European Commission adequacy decision, which means they are considered to offer an adequate level of data protection. ##Other countries do not have the same level of legal protection as countries in the EEA, or with an adequacy decision. If we do transfer your data in this way, we will take steps to ensure that it is protected to the same levels that apply in the EEA. This may include, for example, ensuring that the organisation receiving the data is registered with the EU-US Privacy Shield (in the case of transfers to the USA), or that we use the EU’s model contract clauses.##STORING YOUR DATA##We have a data retention policy, which clearly sets out how long we keep data for, and for what reasons.##We will keep your data only for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose/s for which it was collected in the first place, i.e. as set out in this notice.##For example: If you haven’t accessed your Account for a period of 3 years or more, we will delete your Account.##LEGAL GROUNDS##This notice sets out (above) how we use your data.

"  This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how H20 Wireless, together with Locus Telecommunications, LLC (“H20”, “us”, “our”), collects, uses, and protects certain information that results from visiting our website or purchasing one of our products. H20 is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to the family of websites of H20, including the website of Locus Telecommunications, LLC (“Websites”). **Collection of Personal Information **  H2O Wireless does not directly track any visitors who interact with our website(s), via cookies. H2O Wireless, therefore, does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.  H2O collects personal information such as name, address, e-mail, telephone number, payment data, and service history. This personal information can be collected when you provide it to us such as when you make a purchase from us or call us for assistance with your account. For example, you may provide us a billing address and credit information, including your social security number, when signing up for service or perhaps purchasing a product through our SHOP, online store. H2O also collects anonymous demographic information that is not unique to you such as tracking information gathered as you navigate through the websites. **_Automatically Collected Information:_** We automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, when you visit a Website, our systems automatically collect information such as your IP address and the type of browser you use. Similarly, all wireless communications systems know when your phone is turned on and approximately where the device is physically located; that's how calls or messages are delivered to you in real time.  We use remarketing with Google AdWords. We and third party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the Double Click cookie) together to inform, optimize, and provide advertisements across the internet based on your past visits to our Websites. To remove yourself from our remarketing list, please clear your cache and cookies after you visit our Websites.  **_Information from Other Sources:_** We may obtain information about you from outside sources and add it to or combine it with your account information. For example, we often receive information from the retailer from whom you purchased your H2O phone or device prior to initiating service with us. We also may use commercially available demographic and marketing information from third parties to help us better serve you or inform you about products or services that we think will be of interest to you.  **Use of Personal Information **  We use personal information for billing purposes, to provide services or complete transactions you have requested, to anticipate and resolve problems with your services, and tell you about products or services from H2O or others that we believe better meet your needs. More specifically, H2O may use e-mail, direct mail, and with your prior permission, wireless text messages, to inform you about products or services we think will interest you. You will have the option to unsubscribe or opt out of receiving these marketing or promotional communications, but you will continue to receive customer service-related and technical notifications, and other similar information via email, wireless text messages, or direct mail.  H2O may offer the opportunity to participate in contests, giveaways, or other similar promotions. Except as explained otherwise in the rules for a particular contest, giveaway, or promotion, any personal information you provide will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  Under federal law, you have a right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of information about your telephone usage, the services you buy from us, who you call, and the location of your device on our network when you make a voice call. This information is sometimes referred to as ""Customer Proprietary Network Information,"" ""CPNI,"" “Call Detail Record,” or “CDR.” We share CPNI and other personal information about you with H2O _a_ ffiliates, including Locus Telecommunications, LLC. Before sharing CPNI and/or CDR, we will first notify you of your rights under the law, describe how we intend to use the CPNI and/or CDR, and give you an opportunity to opt out of such usage (or, when required by law, to opt in).  **Information Collected and Used by Third Parties**  Our site includes links to third party websites and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we don’t control. When you access a third party website from an H2O Website, purchase products or services not sold by H2O, or conduct other transactions with third parties, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of those third parties. The third party’s privacy practices may differ from ours. If you can’t find the privacy policy of any third party, you should contact that party directly for more information.  **Email Addresses **  If you provide your email address, from time to time we may send you emails about new products and services, or promotional offers that we believe will interest you. We may also share your email address with marketing partners and/or providers of other products and services that you have indicated an interest in by opting in to receive such communications. Though we hope you’ll find this information useful, if you do not wish to receive such emails, please click on the ""unsubscribe"" link that we include in all of the emails we send. Please note that even if you opt-out of receiving commercial emails, we may still use your email address to answer any email inquiries you send us, to send messages about your account status, to alert you about technical issues, or to follow up on transactions or submissions of information that appear incomplete.  **Information Disclosed to Third Parties**  We disclose personal information to third parties, such as our third party payment provider, when it is necessary to complete a transaction you have requested or to initiate, render, bill, and collect for services. For example, our payment solution providers process your credit card transactions on our behalf. They can only use the personal information we give them to produce the billing statement.  We will also disclose personal information if it is necessary to comply with law (e.g., court orders, subpoenas, E911 information, etc.), to enforce our subscriber agreements, to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our site, our customers, other carriers including our underlying carrier, the public or H2O, and to facilitate or verify the appropriate calculation of taxes, fees, or other obligations due to a local, state, or federal government.  You may also want to use services and products offered by third party providers in conjunction with our wireless service. In those cases, you will be providing information to those third party providers, and information those third parties receive about you will be governed by their privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy. For example, if you are roaming on the network of another carrier, information about your usage and the numbers you dial will be available to the carrier providing the service. And if you bought your wireless device from a third party retailer, both the retailer and H2O will have your personal information as a result of the transaction.  H2O does not sell, rent, or lease its customer lists to third parties.  However, if H2O, one of its business units, or substantially all of its assets are acquired by another company, information about our customers and other visitors to this site would be among the transferred assets.   **Cookies**  To help us tailor our site to the needs and interests of our visitors, we keep track of the web pages visited by placing a small entry in a text file, called a cookie, on your hard drive. The cookie contains an ID number that allows us to track the pages you’ve visited. We aggregate this data with data on the pages visited by other users to track overall visitor traffic patterns. We use this information to improve our site by making it more responsive to the needs of our users. Most browsers allow you to set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you don’t accept cookies, you won’t be able to take advantage of various features on our site that are available to other visitors.  For more information about cookies, please visit <http://www.aboutcookies.org/>. You may opt out of the use of cookies at any time.  **IP Addresses **  Your IP address is a number used to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell us who you are. In addition to collecting your IP address, we also collect information such as the operating system on your computer and the web browser software you’re using to access our site so we can optimize our site for the most popular operating systems and web browsers. And, because we like to know how you found our site, we keep track of where you came from.  **Banner Ads**  H2O may use third-party advertising companies to place banner advertisements about our products and services on other websites. To measure advertising effectiveness and to offer selective ad content, the advertising companies may use an anonymous identifier to learn more about your visits to H2O Websites and other websites. This anonymous identifier is NOT your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, or any other information that personally identifies you. The use of such anonymous identifiers (such as cookies, Web beacons or ""tagging"") is subject to the advertising company's privacy policy, not this Privacy Policy.   **Security**  The information we collect from our customers and visitors to our site is stored in databases we control. Physical access to the servers on which we store visitor information is restricted. We use your credit card information only to bill you for the products and services you order from us. We don’t share your credit card information with anyone, except as may be necessary to process your transactions. To protect the privacy of your credit card number and other ordering information, we encrypt this information for transit over the internet using a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection. However, as effective as modern security practices are, no physical or electronic security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won’t be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet. Most web browsers allow use of an SSL connection. If your browser does not support use of an SSL connection, or if you prefer not to send your credit card number over the internet, you can place your order by calling us toll free at 1-800-643-4926.   **Additional Information for Individuals in the EU**  While H2O is intended solely for personal use in the U.S. only, our privacy policy is aligned with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). If you are located in the European Union (“EU”), and access H20 Websites from the EU, you may have the right to: (1) request access or copies of personal data we process about you, (2) delete your personal data, unless an exception applies (i.e., the data is necessary to comply with an existing legal obligation), and/or (3) object to us processing your personal data in some circumstances (i.e., for direct marketing). Any persons located in the EU may contact customer service at [CustomerService@locus.net](mailto:CustomerService@locus.net) for any inquiries related to the any relevant GDPR protected information.  **Changes to This Privacy Policy**  This Privacy Policy is subject to change. If we need to change this Privacy Policy at some point in the future, we’ll post the revised policy promptly. By using h2owirelessnow.com, you agree that your visit to our site abides by the information contained in our Authorized Use Policy. California customers: H2O does not disclose customers' personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes, as governed by California Civil Code 1798.83.  **Questions or Concerns**  If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please email us at [CustomerService@locus.net](mailto:CustomerService@locus.net).","H2O Wireless does not directly track any visitors who interact with our website(s), via cookies.

"# Privacy Policy - Day One The Day One app and its accompanying services are designed to maintain the private nature of your personal journal. This privacy policy outlines what information is collected and stored by Day One. Bloom Built, Inc. (“​ **Bloom Built** ​,” “​ **we** ​,” “​ **us** ​,” or “​ **our** ​”) operates the Day One application and related websites (each, an “​ **App** ​” or a “​ **Site** ​”, respectively) and several related services (all such services, “Services”). Through our App and Services, we offer you a journaling program to record your memories, and, if you wish, share them with others as well. ## What Information We Collect and How We Use It In the course of using the Sites and Services, we collect both personal and anonymous information. “​ **Personal Information** ​” in this Privacy Policy refers to information that allows someone to identify or contact you. Examples of Personal Information include your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing information. “​ **Anonymous Information** ​” is information not associated with or inherently linked to your Personal Information. Anonymous Information does not enable identification of or contact with individual persons. ### Personal Information We will use your Personal Information to:  * Provide you with Services and customer support;  * Market our products and services to you that we believe may be of interest to you;  * Respond to your requests, resolve disputes and/or troubleshoot problems;  * Improve the quality of the Sites and the Services; and  * Communicate with you about the Sites and the Services. We may also use your Personal Information to create Anonymous Information records by excluding information that makes the information personally identifiable to you. We will communicate with you primarily in the form of push alerts and emails. You can manage the frequency and/or opt out of receiving these communications by changing your settings on the App and/or clicking the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each email. Please note that even if you unsubscribe or opt-out, we may still send you Site and Services related communications (e.g., emails related to your account or the App). We collect the following types of Personal Information: **Device Information:** When you download the App, we may collect your device type, your wireless carrier, and your individual device ID and we associate this with your Personal Information, though we primarily use this information to support your account and provide you with Services. **Account Information:** To use our Services, you must register through the App with our Services and open an “Account” with us by providing your name, email address, and a password. We retain information on your behalf, such as entries, pages and messages that you store using your Account. **Journal Information:** The most important thing we store is your journals. By default, your journals are private. Individual entries may be shared (see “Published Entries” below). **Published Entries:** Day One provides a service, called Publish, that enables users to handpick selected entries to share. Our display of published entries is subject to the privacy settings you establish for them. When you publish or share content (text, images, photographs, messages, comments or any other kind of content that is not your e-mail address) as part of our Services, other users may be able to see it, including anonymous visitors to the Site. Please remember this and be thoughtful about what you publish. **Transactional Information:** When you order Services through our App, we may collect information necessary to complete and record the transaction, though some of this information may go directly to our payment provider. If you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device to send us your location when you publish), we may collect, store and use that information. If you want to deactivate this feature, you can either reinstall the App(s) or deactivate location services on your mobile device. Of course, your location may also be apparent from your entries. **Other Information:** We collect your other Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily as you use our App, Site and Services. If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Services you are able to use. **Location Information:** In some cases we may collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation or by accessing your mobile device’s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device. **Social Media Platforms:** Day One’s Services may include publicly accessible blogs, community forums, or private messaging features. The Site and our other Services may also contain links and interactive features with various social media platforms (e.g., widgets). If you already use these platforms, their cookies may be set on your device when using our Site or other Services. You should be aware that Personal Information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, chat room, social media platform or otherwise online, or that you share in an open forum may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We are unable to control such uses of your information when interacting with a social media platform, and by using such services you assume the risk that the Personal Information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties for any number of purposes. **Third-Party Payment Processing:** We may sell subscriptions or merchandise through our Services. When you make purchases through the Services, we process your payments through a third party application, including the Apple App Store, Google Play App Store, Amazon App Store (together with any similar applications, “App Stores”), Social Networking Sites (“SNS”) such as Facebook, and other third-party payment processers, including Stripe. The third party application may collect certain financial information from you to process a payment on behalf of Day One, including your name, email address, address and other billing information. ### Apple HealthKit We never use your Apple HealthKit data for advertising and similar services or for use-based data mining. We don’t disclose information gained through Apple HealthKit to a third party or sell it to advertising platforms, data brokers, or information resellers. ### Anonymous Information We will use your Anonymous Information to:  * Keep track of logins and personalize your experience (including by tailoring content to you)  * Enhance the Sites or Services  * Improve the content of our software  * Customize the App, Sites or Services to you  * Contact you and/or market our products and services to you on our Sites or through our Services We collect the following types of Anonymous Information: **Information Collected by Our Servers:** To make our Site and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. **Log Files:** As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Site or the Services again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information. **Cookies:** Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. This type of information is collected to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. We use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site and Services. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or other Personal Information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your Personal Information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. **Mobile Services:** We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device if you have downloaded our App(s) to your mobile device. This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used include your geographic location, how you use the App(s), and information about the type of device you use. In addition, in the event our App(s) crash on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our App(s). This information is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual. ### Combining Anonymous and Personal Information: We may combine any of the foregoing Anonymous Information with your Personal Information, in which case we will consider it to be Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. ## How We Disclose Information ### Personal Information We also disclose certain Personal Information:  * To third party vendors who help us provide the Services or the Sites;  * To third parties to whom you ask us to send Personal Information;  * To a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “Affiliates”), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy;  * In connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets.  * In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Information may also be transferred as a business asset.

"Hawaiian Airlines respects the importance of protecting your personal information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand what personally-identifiable information we collect, use, and share when you interact with our websites, mobile applications, email, social media, and online services. When you book with Hawaiian Airlines, or use HawaiianAirlines.com or our mobile application to make an online travel reservation, you may be asked by Hawaiian Airlines or an agent on behalf of Hawaiian Airlines to provide certain personally-identifiable information such as your name, billing address, email address, telephone numbers, payment card number, billing information, dietary requirements and health information relevant to your travel. We will also collect the names and email addresses of any companions who will be traveling on the reservation that you create. This information is used by Hawaiian Airlines and its vendors for purposes such as processing and confirming your reservation, issuing boarding passes and tickets, billing you for the services you purchase, notifying you of any flight changes and cancellations, and notifying you and your travel companions of opportunities to enroll in our HawaiianMiles program and of discounted air travel offers and other special offers that we think may be of interest. We also collect your date of birth and gender as part of the Transportation Security Administration’s (TSA) Secure Flight program and we may also use that information for our operational purposes. By providing personally-identifiable information to Hawaiian Airlines you consent to the collection of information provided by you or on your behalf, and to the use and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. When you enroll in our HawaiianMiles program, we collect certain personally-identifiable information such as your name, address, email address, and phone numbers. When you enroll, you will also have an opportunity to sign up for Hawaiian Airlines email updates about special discounted air fares, travel specials, Hawaiian Airlines MasterCard® credit and Bankoh Hawaiian Airlines Visa® check card programs, HawaiianMiles Partner programs, and other communications. The information you provide when you enroll is used for purposes such as establishing your HawaiianMiles account, ensuring that you receive appropriate mileage credit for travel purchases and purchases of qualifying products and services from participating Partners, communicating with you about your account status, and sending you any updates you request and notifying you of special offers and promotions we think may be of interest to you. Children may become members of HawaiianMiles but may not submit personally-identifiable information through this site. Any information regarding HawaiianMiles account members 13 years of age and under must be submitted by their parent or legal guardian. On occasion, we may provide contact information for our HawaiianMiles members to certain third party mailers and e-mailers we rely on to notify you of special offers and ways to earn travel awards through HawaiianMiles. We select these third parties carefully and require them to establish safeguards to protect the privacy of our customers and the confidentiality of the information we share. If you wish to unsubscribe your email address from the lists that we use to send promotional email offers to HawaiianMiles members, please visit our Unsubscribe page or click the ‘Unsubscribe’ link at the bottom of each email. Members can also modify email preferences at any time and subscribe to or unsubscribe from any promotional email update services that we offer by logging into ‘My Account’ and accessing our Email Update/Account Info page. Alternatively, you can also call us toll-free at 877-HA-MILES (426-4537). When you enroll in HawaiianMiles via the Internet, you will be asked to select a password. You may also be asked to record the answer to a secret security question that can be used to obtain a temporary password in the event that you forget your password in the future. You may also be asked to supply a PIN if you use our telephone Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system. Your password and PIN are intended to protect your account information from future unauthorized access. Hawaiian Airlines will not be responsible for any lost, stolen, or otherwise disclosed passwords or PINs. Additionally, Hawaiian Airlines will not replace or reinstate any flight credits or HawaiianMiles, partner miles, or program awards that are generated or redeemed through the unauthorized use of your PIN or password. Accordingly, you should guard your password and PIN carefully and not provide them to anyone.  If you enroll in HawaiianMiles, you can choose to establish a personal profile that stores information about your travel companions and the payment cards that you use to book your travel arrangements. This is an optional service and is provided for your convenience. You are not required to store any information in your profile about your travel companions or payment cards to become a HawaiianMiles member or to use our website to make online reservations. However, if you choose to store this information in your profile, you generally will be able to complete the online reservation process more quickly. We use the information you store in your personal profile to pre-populate certain data fields in the online forms we use during the reservation process (so as to eliminate the need for you to retype the same information multiple times), to perform a variety of booking functions, and to bill you for the services that you purchase. When you store travel companion information in your profile, you will be asked to enter the first and last names of your travel companions, information about their age and frequent flyer program enrollment status and account numbers. To store payment card information in your profile, we ask for your payment card type, card number, expiration date, billing address(es) and a payment card “nickname” (e.g., “My Platinum MasterCard”) that you can use to quickly recognize your account. Payment card information is stored in an encrypted form. (See “Security” below for more details regarding our encryption practices.) You can modify, update or delete stored travel companion or payment card information in your profile at any time by logging into ‘My Account’ and accessing the Update Travel Companions page and/or Update Payment Info page.

Hawaiian Airlines has widespread International operations. Accordingly, any or all of the disclosures of personally-identifiable information described in the Privacy Policy may involve the transfer of your information across national and international borders to individuals and organizations located outside of the country where your information was collected.

Prior to being stored, passwords are encrypted using a one-way hash algorithm, and payment card numbers are encrypted using the symmetric encryption algorithm Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

We cannot guarantee the security of our servers or databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. Hawaiian Airlines endeavors to ensure that personally-identifiable information it holds is accurate and up-to-date.

"We at KTM respect and protect the privacy of all our customers and visitors to our website (hereinafter “visitors”) and adhere strictly to the regulations under data protection law. Personal data will be collected on this website only to the extent required. Under no circumstances will the data stored be sold. The following policy gives you an overview of how we ensure this protection and the information required under Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation on the processing of your data, in particular which categories of data KTM stores in respect of the users of the website www.ktm.comand/or customers of authorized KTM dealers, and for what purpose. This Privacy Policy applies to all KTM websites and all products and services that KTM offers. In this context, this KTM Privacy Policy also applies in respect of all KTM group companies which may collect and/or process data. **Collection and processing of personal data** In general, it is not necessary to provide personal data in order to use our website. However, we may require your personal data insofar as it is necessary for the performance of a contract with us or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures (see Art. 6 (1) (b) of the GDPR). All your personal data, specifically your email address, your name, your residential address, and your date of birth, are collected by us only when you provide this to us, for example, in performing a contract, processing an order, in the context of a competition, providing informational material or a survey, as well as registering for newsletters. Visitors can of course choose not to provide any data in order to use the website anonymously, but must then be aware that some functions may in certain circumstances only be available to a limited extent. KTM recognizes and respects the importance of the responsible use of the data collected from visitors and customers. KTM will not use this data to contact you and inform you of product news, services and offers without your permission. **Transfer of personal data to third parties** If required by law or contract, or if we have a legal and legitimate interest, it may be necessary in an individual case to submit your data to our group companies or external business partners. Your data will not be sold, leased, or otherwise transmitted to external third parties. This does not include: trustworthy partners who support us in operating the website, in the course of doing business, or in other services in which it is, of course, ensured that they are obligated to maintain confidentiality. Within the scope of processing your order or request, we sometimes commission external business partners, who are, however, contractually obliged to comply with the data protection regulations. The transmission of the data to the group companies of KTM or other third parties shall only take place to the extent such recipients have provided KTM with an undertaking to observe the applicable data protection regulations. Insofar as we involve external business partners in the context of data processing, we have ensured that these have been selected and are monitored in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions and are also obliged to comply with the data protection regulations and laws. Apart from this, your data is not transferred. We also take in-house data protection within the group very seriously. Our employees and subcontracted business partners are obliged by us to maintain confidentiality and to adhere to the data protection regulations. The respective KTM group company works with trustworthy partners. Specifically, your personal data may be transmitted to the following group companies or business partners: **Collection and storage of usage data** When accessing the website, the following electronic communication metadata are stored: IP address, date and time of access, name of the file called up, sub-page as well as anonymous username, city, user’s region and country, user’s operating system, user’s browser, user’s browser version, user’s interactions on the website, pages visited by the user, duration of the session and number of sessions of the user, date of the first visit to the website, date and time of each interaction of the user, time spent on the website, duration of requests by the user, user’s requests, exception errors of the website, date and time and duration of exception errors.

We delete or anonymize your data as soon as it is no longer needed for the transmission of a communication. If the processing of the electronic communications metadata is for billing purposes, we shall retain the relevant communication metadata up to the end of the period during which the invoice may be legally challenged or the claim for payment asserted. We store this electronic communications metadata for a period of three years from the conclusion of the contract because in terms of the Austrian General Civil Code (ABGB) a claim on the grounds of error must be asserted within three years from conclusion of the contract (see Art. 1487 of the ABGB) and claims for supplies of goods or services to a commercial business lapse after three years (see Art. 1486, para. 1, line 1 of the ABGB). **Cookies** Cookies may be used on certain KTM websites.

All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway providers database, only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and who are required to keep the information confidential. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

We will retain and use this Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, and to resolve any issues relating to fraud or other cyber threats. **Information Sharing and Disclosure** We share your Personal Information with our third party vendors who assist us and enable us to provide the Sites and services.

You will be notified in advance of any rights you may have to block or object to this transfer of your information. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our Site policies, or protect our or other’s rights, property, or safety, or to assist with any online fraud or cyber threats.

If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you, which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours.

Since we do not make such disclosures, we are exempt from these reporting requirements. In addition, we currently do not honor Do Not Track signals. **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance** We are in compliance with the requirements of COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act), as we do not knowingly collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age.

However, under the law, we are not required to provide this information as long as we: (1) notify you that you have the right to prevent disclosure of personal information, and (2) provide you with a cost-free means to exercise that right. As noted in this Privacy Policy, we require California residents to opt-in to activities where we would share their personal information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and you would like to prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to participate in these activities. If you are a California resident, and you have opted in to one of these activities, but you later decide that you would like to prevent our disclosure of your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please contact us through the following link.##TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT##Overview. The information we gather generally falls into one of two categories: (1) information (for example, your name and address) that you voluntarily supply when you register with our Service, initiate transactions on or through the Service (such as buying products or services through the Service), or when you participate in the features we offer through the Service (such as comments posted on a blog, discussion group, or other social networking features on the Service), and (2) information gathered on usage patterns and preferences as visitors navigate through our Service. In some cases, one of our agents or Affiliates may collect the information on our behalf. Third party Service Providers (as defined below) that provide all or some of the services available through this Service also may be gathering the same kinds of information.##Registration Information. To make use of certain features available through this Service (such as to receive email newsletters, to post a classified ad, or to participate in some social networking features) you may need to register and to provide certain information as part of the registration process. (If permitted by this Service, you may be able to bypass some of the steps within the registration process by using your user name and password associated with your account on certain specified social networking sites when you register for our Service, but you will still have to complete the registration process after entering that information.) We or our Service Providers may also ask for information from you if you buy products or services or conduct other transactions via our Service. (We may ask, for example, for your name, email address, sex, age, zip code or credit card number, and we might request information on your interest in sports, personal finance, the performing arts, and the like.) The information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our Service to your interests and make them more useful to you, and also may be used in the processing of e-commerce transactions. In addition, our Service Providers may provide us with additional personal information about you that you provide to them through your separate accounts with them as described in their own privacy statements.##The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying such information is entirely voluntary. But if you don’t supply the information we request, we may be unable to provide you with services we make available to other users of our Service. For instance, we can’t send you email alerting you to a new service we’re offering, or breaking news that may interest you, if you don’t tell us what you’re interested in and give us your email address.##Contests and Other Promotions. From time to time, we may offer contests, sweepstakes or other promotions via our Service. If you enter one of these contests, sweepstakes or promotions, you’ll have to provide information about yourself (such as your name, address, telephone number and email address) so that we can administer and operate the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion (including contacting you if you win, fulfilling a prize, and publishing a winners’ list). If you don’t want us to collect the information requested in the registration form or to provide it to any of our Affiliates, Service Providers and co-sponsor(s) as described below, please do not enter the contest, sweepstakes or promotion.##Additional personal information may unintentionally be collected if such information is provided in video, recording, photographs, etc. that you submit. Personal information included in a video, recording, photograph, etc. is by its nature available to the general public and you should not submit videos, recordings or photographs if you desire to keep any of the content private; and we are not responsible for the use or misuse of such content by any third party.##Email Newsletters. We may also offer you the opportunity to subscribe to email newsletters that we make available through the Service. If you have opted to receive a particular newsletter, you may always unsubscribe later if you decide not to receive further mailings of the newsletter from us.##Cookies. To help make our sites more responsive to the needs and interests of our visitors, we keep track of the pages visited by our users by placing a cookie, a small entry in a text file, on your hard drive. Our advertisers and Service Providers may also assign their own cookies to your browser, which is a process that we don’t control.##We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs and to deliver a better, more personalized service. For example, we may use cookies to personalize the ads you see on our Service or to avoid showing you the same ad repeatedly during a single visit. In addition, we may use cookies to track the pages on our Service, the Sinclair Network of Sites, or other sites visited by our users. We may also use cookies to measure site performance and/or advertising performance. We can build a better Service if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. You can manage your browser’s cookie setting through the “options” menu on most commercially available web browsers, including options to set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie or to disable cookies entirely. Of course, if you set your browser not to accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users of our Service.##Web Beacons. Our Service may contain electronic images (called “single-pixel GIFs” or “web beacons”) or other tools that allow us and our Affiliates, Service Providers, vendors and, where necessary, our advertisers to count users who have visited particular pages of this Service, the Sinclair Network of Sites, or other sites or applications, or to access certain cookies. We may use these tools and other technologies to recognize which the links visitors click and to track how users respond to ads we place on third-party sites or applications. These features may also be included in our email newsletters so that we can learn which messages have been opened and acted upon. In combination with cookies, these web beacons allow us (and/or our Affiliates, Service Providers, vendors, or advertisers) to track the number of users who view particular pages and to fine tune the advertising messages delivered to users of this Service and other websites and applications. We may use “clickstream” data collected using web beacons and cookies to help us tailor promotional content, including such content in email messages and on landing pages, to the perceived interests of our users. Advertising networks with which we are affiliated and third-party advertising services that we use may also use web beacons on our Service to gather similar anonymous “clickstream” information, which is used to fine tune advertising messages delivered to our visitors and visitors to other websites.##Browser Level Information and IP Addresses. Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer configuration or your mobile device when you use our Service, including the type of browser software you use, the operating system you’re running, the resolution of your computer monitor or mobile device, the website that referred you, the type of device you’re using, and your IP address. (Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by computers and mobile devices connected to the Internet to identify your computer or mobile device so that data (such as the web pages you want to view) can be transmitted to you. We also use IP address information for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. Your IP address alone does not tell us who you are.) We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our Service (including ads distributed through our Service) to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our Service.##Social Networks. When you use the social networking features on our Service, you may be asked to log in to a social network using your social network credentials (for example, your Facebook user ID). When you log in, we may collect information about you (including personal information) from that social network. In addition, when you use one of the social networks sharing tools available on our Service, the social network operating the tool may collect information about you based on such use. The social network’s use of that information will be subject to its own privacy policy, which may be different from ours.##Mobile Applications and Location-Based Information. Our Service may have the ability to use your geographic location to deliver content, services, and advertising tailored to your location. If you choose to enable our Service to use your location information, then that information will be stored and used to deliver content, services, and advertising tailored to your location. Also, when you use a mobile device or browser to access our Service, then your device and/or your browser may automatically collect and/or transmit your device’s unique identifier, IP address, location information, device make/model, wireless provider, and related information to us and our Service Providers. We and our Service Providers may use this information to deliver content, services, and advertising tailored to your location.##Data Collected in Connection with Ad Serving and Targeting. We use third-party Service Providers, such as ad networks, to serve advertising to you when you use our Service or use other sites or applications. These Service Providers may use information about your activities while you navigate through and use this Service and other web sites and applications (and that the Service Providers collect through cookies) to provide you with advertisements about products and services that they think may be of interest to you. The information used by these Service Providers for these purposes generally does not identify you personally (in other words, the Service Providers are not usually using your name, address, email address, or phone number for these purposes, although they may use your IP address, your geographic location, or your device’s unique identifier). As it pertains to Facebook, Facebook could be collecting information and/or serving targeted advertising using information gleaned from your use of both our Service and Facebook’s services. Facebook does not share the information it collects with us; however, we refer you to Facebook’s policies for information on its practices — see Facebook Data Policy at https://www.facebook.com/policy.php. You can learn more about data collection practices (http://www.networkadvertising.org), and/or opt out of any use by our Service Providers of cookies to tailor advertising to your interests, by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.##DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION##Why We Collect Information From You. Like any business, it’s important for us to know our customers — their needs, their likes, what they want and expect from us. Unlike most businesses, however, we deliver a valuable product to our customers without asking for anything in return. Since we make most of this Service available without charge to you, we rely heavily on advertisers to produce the income necessary to operate our Service. Advertisers are like most people: They expect something in return for the money they spend. They want to know how many people will see their ad and how often our users are looking at their ads on our Service — in other words, how effective their ad is likely to be. So it’s important that we be able to tell advertisers who our audience is. Except as expressly set forth in this privacy statement, we will not provide, sell or rent to any third party any personally identifying information that we collect from you through your use of this Service.##Advertisers. Without your permission, we will not share the personally-identifying information you provide when registering on our Service with advertisers. We may, however, take the information you provide and aggregate it with data from all the other people that use this Service and associated services. Then we will use that pool of information to inform our advertisers about our audience without identifying you personally.##Service Providers. All or portions of our Service may be provided or supported by our third-party service providers (“Service Providers”), and we may share any of the information that we collect from you through our Service (e.g., anonymous information collected through cookies on your browser, information you submit to us to enter a contest, sweepstakes or promotion offered through the Service, etc.) with such Service Providers. In the event we offer services through this Service such as chat, email newsletters, email services, online classifieds and/or similar services, such services may be made available through cooperative arrangements with providers that specialize in operating such services. In some instances, our Service Providers will have the same access to your information as we do. Their use of the information will be subject to the terms of their respective privacy policies.##Contest Co-Sponsors. If you enter any contest, sweepstakes or other promotion that we make available through this Service, we may share the information you submit to us with the co-sponsor(s) of the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. We will identify any co-sponsor(s) in the official rules for the promotion.##Our Affiliates. We may share any of the information that we collect from you (including anonymous information and personally identifying information that you may provide) with the other Sinclair Affiliate Sites within the Sinclair Network of Sites so that we and they can provide you with products and services that may be of interest to you.##Statistical Information. Much of the information we collect is in the form of aggregated statistics, such as the traffic that visits various pages within our Service, and the habits and preferences of our audience. Such aggregated information does not include any information that would identify you personally. We may use such aggregated information and disclose it to any third parties as we see fit. Information You Post. Please remember that anything you post to any message boards, discussion or comment areas, or social networking services on our Service can be seen, collected, and used by anyone who has access to that board, area, or social networking service. We cannot control how your postings may be used by third parties with such access.##Sites to Which We Link. Our Service includes links to plenty of other websites, and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we don’t control. When you access another site or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through their sites, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy statement of the operator of the site you’re visiting or the provider of such products or services.##Other Disclosures. We reserve the right to release information about users of our Service when release is necessary or appropriate to comply with law, to enforce this privacy statement or our visitor agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of our Service, the public, our customers, or our company and its employees, agents, partners and Affiliates. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that we merge with another entity or otherwise transfer substantially all of our assets to another entity (including, without limitation, to one of our Affiliates as part of an internal reorganization), information collected from this Service would be among the transferred assets.##Maintenance of Information. We may store all information, videos, photographs, recordings, etc. in our database even after such content has been deleted from public display. In addition, our web logs may be stored indefinitely. Although we use customary practices to store all information received from our users in a secure operating environment that is not available to general public, no guarantee can be provided that such information might not become available to persons outside of Sinclair and its Affiliate.##SHOPPING##When you purchase products and/or services through our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain information, including your contact details (such as your name, address, telephone and email), and your billing information (such as your credit card number and the date that your card expires). We may also ask you to provide additional information such as unique identifiers (such as your date of birth), and registration information (login name and password).##We will use the information you provide us to process your transaction and to contact you regarding your purchase if necessary. We will share this information with our Service Providers to the extent necessary to facilitate your purchase (for purposes such as customer service, verification, fulfillment and billing purposes). We will not sell or rent your personal billing information to any third party. We may share non-financial information with our Service Providers in accordance with this privacy statement.##OPTING IN/OPTING OUT##In certain places on this Service (for example, when registering as a user of this Service, managing your account, shopping, or participating in activities like promotional contests), we may ask you to consent to the sharing of your information with third parties with which we have business relationships. If you provide such consent (for example, by checking a box or by some other means), we will make your information available to such third parties as described in the consent form so that they, we, or both may contact you directly regarding special offers, promotions, products or services that may be of interest to you. If you register with this Service, you will have the opportunity to review or update the information you have provided us at any time. You also have the option of deleting all information except for your email address. If you would like to completely deactivate your account, please follow this link. Please note, however, that if you deactivate your account, you will not receive any newsletters from us and you will not be able to participate in any of our sweepstakes or contests. Also, even if you deactivate your account, you still need to go through a separate process to unsubscribe from any SMS alerts you previously signed up to receive. You can unsubscribe from these alerts by using the “STOP” function within those messages. You agree that, subject to applicable law, we may use your information to contact you for customer service, to inform you of important changes or additions to our Service or the services offered over our Service and to send you administrative notices or any communications relevant to your use of our Service.##If you have subscribed to one of our email newsletters, you will always have the opportunity to unsubscribe from future mailings (for example, by clicking on an unsubscribe link in an email newsletter or by modifying your account settings on our Service).##If you have submitted your information on a page provided in conjunction with one of our Service Providers, the information you submit may be jointly maintained by us and the Service Provider. If you decide to opt out of our Service, you may also need to contact the Service Provider separately to request the Service Provider to remove your information from its database.##DATA SECURITY##All information gathered through our Service is stored within database(s) operated by us or by a Service Provider on our behalf. We and/or our Service Providers secure the personally identifying information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For e-commerce transactions where you provide sensitive financial data (e.g., credit card information) to us via this Service, our Service Providers transmit your billing information using encryption. Encryption scrambles your credit card number and personal information. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won’t be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.##A NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN’S PRIVACY##This Service is not directed at children under the age of 13, and we won’t knowingly allow anyone under age 13 to register with our Service or to provide any other personally identifying information. If you’re under 13, please do not provide us with any personally identifying information about yourself (such as your name, your email address or your phone number). If we become aware that we have collected any personally identifying information from a user under the age of 13, we will remove such information from our records as soon as possible.##CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT##We may change the terms of this privacy statement or introduce new terms and conditions from time to time, in which case we will post an updated version of this privacy statement on this Service and will update the “Last Updated” date above to reflect the date the changes take effect. By continuing to use this Service after we post any such changes, you accept this Privacy Policy, as modified.##Questions regarding this Privacy Policy should be directed to us at the followinglink.","This Privacy Statement is provided by the Sinclair Affiliate that operates this website (“We,” “us” or “our”) to explain the ways in which we collect information from you through your use of this site and any services offered through this website and any of our applications or mobile applications (collectively, the “Service”), and the ways that we and the other Sinclair Affiliated Sites may use that information.

If you have your browser set to notify you before accepting cookies, the notice will tell you if the cookie expires some time in the future or not.

Cookies are small text files that this Website sends to your computer for record-keeping purposes and this information is stored in a file on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies make web surfing and browsing easier for you by saving your preferences so that we can use these to improve your next visit to this Website.  * One of the purposes of cookies is to simplify the use of the Website. A cookie may save a user’s login details, for example, so that the user does not need to login every time. Cookies, by themselves, do not provide us with your personal information.  * Cookies may be either “persistent” or “temporary” (or “session”) cookies. A persistent cookie retains user preferences for a particular Website, allowing those preferences to be used in future browsing sessions and remains valid until its set expiration date (unless deleted by the user before the expiration date). A temporary cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.  * Cookies are also used for statistical or marketing purposes, to determine how the Website is used. These cookies are provided by us as well as by third parties (e.g., advertising partners). While we do not control or have access to advertiser cookies, we do permit those cookies to be used on this Website to facilitate tailored advertising and to monitor patterns of buying specific goods or interest in, for example, holidays or hobbies. These cookies run advertisements tailored to the user based on the user’s online buying habits.  * For a current list of the advertising partners who use cookies on this Website, and to modify your cookies settings, please access our Cookie Consent tool. Additionally, your browser may be set to allow you to be notified when a cookie is to be placed on your browser, decline the cookie, or delete cookies that have been placed on your browser. Some functions of our Websites may not work or may work slowly if a cookie is refused.  * **Google Analytics:** We use Google Analytics to help us get a better understanding of how visitors use this Website. The information generated by the Google Analytics cookie about your use of this Website is transmitted to and stored by Google. If you do not want your activity on this Website to be tracked by Google Analytics, you may opt out by using this link: <http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en>  * **Other Non-Personal Information:** In addition to any personally identifiable information or other information that you choose to provide to us on the Websites, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies, now and hereafter devised, that automatically collect certain web site usage information whenever you visit or interact with the Websites. This information may include browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, the source of the request, the preceding page view, and other similar information. We may use this usage information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Websites. In addition, we may also collect your IP address or some other unique identifier for the particular device you use to access the Internet, as applicable (collectively, referred to herein as a "" **Device Identifier** ""). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Computer, and we may identify your device by its Device Identifier. When analyzed, usage information helps us determine how our Websites are used, such as what types of visitors arrive at the Websites, what type of content is most popular, what type of content you may find most relevant and what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising. We may associate your Device Identifier or web site usage information with the personally identifiable information you provide, but we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information.  We use non-personal information in a variety of ways, including to help analyze site traffic, understand customer needs and trends, carry out targeted promotional activities and to improve our services. We may use your non-personal information by itself or aggregate it with information we have obtained from others. We may share your non-personal information with our affiliated companies and third parties to achieve these objectives and others, but remember that aggregate information is anonymous information that does not personally identify you. We may provide our analysis and certain non-personal information to third parties (who may in turn use this information to provide advertisements tailored to your interests), but this will not involve disclosing any of your personally identifiable information.  * **Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op:** WHG participates in the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op to better understand how you use our Websites across the various devices you use, and to deliver tailored promotions.

For example, if you elect to connect your social media account to your Website account, certain personal information from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include personal information that is part of your profile or your friends’ profiles.  * **Mobile Devices:** When you use or access our Services from a mobile device, we may collect information such as your unique device ID and your location information.

Your information and profile will be displayed to all members of the LoopDesk Site and may be featured in areas such as the Featured Members area or the Members You May Know area. We may use your email address to send you notices of upgrades or changes to the Site, the Terms of Service or the Privacy Policy as well as new services, special offers and other communications. All personal information you submit to the Site will be protected by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you link to another site or sign up for an affiliate program or contest or answer an advertisement through the Site, you are submitting your personal information to that vendor. Any personal information you volunteer to that vendor is subject to the terms and condition of that vendor’s privacy policy. _When you _enter__ _the Site_ , we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered from all users of the Site and is used primarily to help diagnose and fix any technical problems and to recognize you when you return to the Site (we keep track of your email address and password when you are signed in so you don’t have to re-sign in every time you visit a new page on the Site). In addition, we use the information to measure traffic and visiting patterns on the Site and on other websites on the Internet. We may also compile statistics and other data about our customers on an aggregate basis, and may share such aggregate data with selected third parties. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of data stored on your computer tied to information about you. Some third-party advertisers may also use cookies when their ads are viewed on the Site. These cookies help us provide you with customized content.

Non-Personal Information: ##In addition to any personally identifiable information or other information that you choose to provide to us on the Websites, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies, now and hereafter devised, that automatically collect certain web site usage information whenever you visit or interact with the Websites. This information may include browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, the source of the request, the preceding page view, and other similar information. We may use this usage information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Websites. In addition, we may also collect your IP address or some other unique identifier for the particular device you use to access the Internet, as applicable (collectively, referred to herein as a ‘Device Identifier’). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Computer, and we may identify your device by its Device Identifier. When analyzed, usage information helps us determine how our Websites are used, such as what types of visitors arrive at the Websites, what type of content is most popular, what type of content you may find most relevant and what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising. We may associate your Device Identifier or web site usage information with the personally identifiable information you provide, but we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information. Web site usage information may be collected using various methods, such as the following: Web Beacons – Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as ‘1×1 GIFs’ or ‘clear GIFs’) may be included in our web pages and e-mail messages.

In certain instances, we may provide you with tools on the Websites that will allow you to set your preferences for receiving e-mail communications from us; that is, agree to some communications but not others. You may ‘opt out’ of receiving future commercial e-mail communications from us by clicking the ‘unsubscribe’ link or following the other instructions included at the bottom of most e-mails we send, or as provided below in Section I; provided, however, we reserve the right to send you transactional e-mails such as customer service communications. ##2.Transfer of Assets: ##As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets. If another entity acquires us or all (or substantially all) of our assets, the personally identifiable information and non-personal information we have about you will be transferred to and used by this acquiring entity, though we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your preferences are followed. Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties. ##3.Other: ##Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable or non-personal information about you if we are required to do so by law, with respect to notices and counter-notices pursuant to our DMCA notice and takedown policy and procedures and/or if we believe that such action is necessary to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend our legal rights or property, our Websites, or other users; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of our Websites’ users or the general public. ##4.Sweepstakes Contests and Promotions: ##We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions through the Websites that may require registration. By entering any promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the promotion. If you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion, personally identifiable information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the promotion’s official rules, such as on a winners list. ##5.Your California Privacy Rights: ##(a) Residents of the State of California, under certain provisions of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed certain personally identifiable information as defined under California law during the preceding year for third party direct marketing purposes. You are limited to one request per calendar year. In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. You may request the information in writing as provided in Section I.??(b) How We Respond to Browser ‘Do Not Track’ Signals. Some web browsers incorporate a ‘Do Not Track’ feature that signals to Websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b)(as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how HackTheMenu Interactive responds to ‘Do Not Track’ signals. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform so a standard technological response has not yet been developed by the policy and technological communities. For this reason, we do not respond to Do Not Track signals currently, and we await the result of work by the policy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take. HackTheMenu does provide a means for opting out of targeted advertising on our Websites, and that opt-out feature can be found in this Privacy Policy. The effect of an opt-out will be to stop targeted advertising, but it will still allow the collection of usage data for certain purposes (e.g. research, analytics and internal online services operation purposes). ##6.Third Party Ad Server Networks:? ##The Websites may use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on the Websites and may use traffic measurement services to analyze traffic on the Websites. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to the Websites and other websites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. The Websites’ third party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies and other technologies on your Computer and track certain behavioral information regarding users of your Computer via a Device Identifier. These third party cookies and other technologies are set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third party cookies, web beacons, and other third party technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. While we may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the Websites, a means for opting out of targeted advertising on our Websites can be found at http://www.aboutads.info/, which provides information regarding the practice of behavioral tracking by and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the ‘opt-out’ procedures. Opting out of the vendors on aboutads.info only means that those vendors will no longer be able to deliver targeted content and/or ads to you, which will affect this and other web sites, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. In addition, opting out may still allow the collection of usage data for certain purposes (e.g., research, analytics and for internal online services operation purposes). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your aboutads.info opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Additional information is available on the web site above. HackTheMenu.com has implemented the following Google Analytics Advertising Features: Remarketing with Google Analytics and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. Visitors can opt-out of the Google Analytics Advertising Features used on this website, including through Ads Settings, Ad Settings for mobile apps, or any other available means (for example, the NAI’s consumer opt-out). ##If you have not opted out of third-party ad serving, the cookies of other third-party vendors or ad networks may also be used to serve ads on your site, and should be disclosed in your privacy policy as well in the following manner. ##‘ Notify your site visitors of the third-party vendors and ad networks serving ads on your site.##‘ Provide links to the appropriate vendor and ad network websites.##‘ Inform your users that they may visit those websites to opt out of the use of cookies for interest-based advertising (if the vendor or ad network offers this capability). Alternatively, you can direct users to opt out of some third-party vendor’s use of cookies for interest-based advertising by visiting aboutads.info ##D. PUBLIC FORUMS##We may offer chat rooms, message boards, bulletin boards or similar public forums where you and other users of our Websites can communicate. The protections described in this Privacy Policy do not apply when you provide information (including personally identifiable information) in connection with your use of these public forums. We may use personally identifiable and non-personal information about you to identify you with a posting in a public forum.

KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE##We have implemented security measures we consider reasonable and appropriate to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and are not responsible for the theft, destruction or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information.

From time to time we evaluate new technology for protecting information, and when appropriate, we upgrade our information security systems. ##G. OTHER SITES/LINKS##Our Websites may link to or contain links to other third party websites that we do not control or maintain, such as in connection with purchasing products referenced on our Websites and banner advertisements.

The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust of our users. Below is information regarding MacNN's commitment to protect the privacy of users and to ensure the integrity of the Internet.##User Information##During your visit to the site, MacNN does not collect any personally-identifiable information about you beyond what you specifically volunteer. This information may be volunteered when you create an account through the MacNN discussion forums or article comment system. However, even then, MacNN does not use that stored information for any purpose other than to allow you to log in and post messages.##MacNN does, however, automatically collect certain non-personally-identifiable information about you, such as your browser type and the IP address that your ISP designates to your machine (which, usually changes periodically depending of your type of Internet connection). This is standard practice for web sites, and is not used for any purpose other than to statistically evaluate how we can design the site to best serve your needs. This information is not sold to any third parties or available to anybody outside of the MacNN staff.##Cookies##Along with countless other Web sites, MacNN uses cookies to enhance your experience. Cookies are used in the MacNN discussion forums to keep track of which messages have been posted since your last visit, easing the navigation of the forums. Cookies can also store your user name and password so that you do not have to log in each time you want to post a message or article comment, though you must specifically request that this feature be turned on. Other user settings such as preferred site display options are also managed by cookies.##Cookie data is not stored on the server, and therefore, not available for viewing by MacNN staff or any third parties. However, it is possible that security flaws exist in some browsers that would allow other site administrators to write malicious scripts that would collect this data without MacNN's knowledge, though this is quite unlikely.##Third-party Ad Server##A portion of the advertisements displayed on the MacNN Network are served by third-party advertisement providers, including Advertising.com, TribalFusion, Google, and Federated Media.

The yield on the bond was between 4.2 and 4.3 percent, much lower than comparable bond offerings from other large companies. Apple uses the bonds to raise money for its US operations, including stock buybacks and dividend distribution, since most of its profits come from foreign sales it cannot ""repatriate"" to the US without paying a second, and much higher, tax rate on the profits than it paid in the countries it uses for foreign headquarters. http://bit.ly/1PgSSqk##Apple's landing page for the live stream of its WWDC keynote, broadcast live from the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco on Monday June 13 at 10AM Pacific, is now live. While the keynote will be available to the public, most other events broadcast through the company's Apple TV channel (supported on second-generation and later) will be limited to those with developer accounts. The keynote, which uses HTTP Live Streaming technology, can also be accessed on iOS devices running iOS 7 or higher, Macs using Safari 6.0.5 or later, and on Windows PCs using Microsoft Edge for Windows 1.0. http://apple.co/1tfOrbi##The standalone iOS app for free educational service iTunes U has been updated to add support for storing and retrieving documents from various cloud services, ranging from Apple's own iCloud to third-party ones such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and Box. Users must simply have an existing account with the various services, and have the mobile app version of the service installed and signed in. The update also allows the importing of managed class rosters from Apple School Manager, and the ability to use Notability and Explain Everything project files as course materials or hand-ins from students. The update is available on the iOS App Store. [42.0MB]  ##Internet and cable TV provider Comcast has announced a new Xfinity gigabit-speed service for residents and businesses in Nashville, Tennessee, in reaction to municipal community-owned and Google Fiber ISP competition. Customers willing to commit to a three-year contract will see 1Gbps down and 35Mbps up, with no data cap, for $70 per month, though the month-by-month price is a significantly more expensive deal: $140 per month, with a 1TB data cap. Comcast and AT&T have vigorously opposed municipal cable efforts like EPB in Chattanooga, which offers up to 1Gbps speeds for $70 per month without contracts. http://bit.ly/1Uxwiex##According to Swiss media reports, Apple Pay could be launching in Switzerland on the same day as the kickoff of Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference -- Monday, June 13. The reports could be a foreshadowing of major announcements at WWDC about Apple Pay expansion in Europe, where merchants are far better prepared for NFC payments of all types (both ""contactless"" physical cards, and mobile wallet systems) than in the US. The news comes on the heels of Canada's banks fully rolling out Apple Pay support last week. Thus far, the US, Canada, Australia, Singapore, and mainland China are the only countries fully supporting Apple Pay. http://bit.ly/1UxuSkh##The US International Trade Commission will investigate a complaint against Apple and AT&T brought by haptic technology company Immersion, alleging that Apple's smartphones and some laptops violate Immerision's patents through the use of Force Touch and 3D Touch. ""The complaint ... alleges violations of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 in the importation into the United States and sale of certain mobile and portable electronic devices incorporating haptics (including smartphones and laptops) and components thereof that infringe patents asserted by the complaint,"" the announcement says in part. Immersion is seeking a limited exclusion order, and ""cease and desist"" orders. http://1.usa.gov/1UxqZff##Fujitsu today unveiled ScanSnap Cloud, a new service that enables ScanSnap scanner customers to simply send data directly from their ScanSnap iX500 or iX100 scanners to popular cloud-based services such as Dropbox, Evernote, Expensify, Google, and OneDrive. Customers can simply set profiles for each category by selecting the cloud service of their choice in the free, dedicated app, and ScanSnap Cloud automatically sorts and delivers the data while delivering optimized scanned images with automatic paper-size and color detection, automatic page rotation and blank-page removal using 'Smart Naming' to name files using extracted keywords and dates from the scanned documents. It is now available for all new and current ScanSnap iX Series customers at www.ScanSnapCloud.com. http://bit.ly/1UxqxgW","MacNews.com does not collect any personally-identifiable information about you beyond what you specifically volunteer.

"We collect personal data from you when you use our websites and services… …and we need your permission before we can continue to provide you with our services. In order to give us permission to collect and use your personal data you must be at least 16 years old or have permission from your parent or legal guardian. If you do not understand this section, please do not continue before you have asked your parent or legal guardian for help. __ ## What data we collect and why. We may collect and store a variety of data from you, depending on how you use our services. For example, we collect and store the information you give us when you: buy a ticket for a performance, a public event (eg talks), exhibition admission or guided tour; book a workshop, course or training session; make a donation; buy a product at our online shop; use one of the Globe’s websites, such as [Teach Shakespeare](http://teach.shakespearesglobe.com/) or [Globe Player](https://globeplayer.tv/); subscribe to receive e-communications; and during meetings with members of staff. The information that we collect may include your name, email and postal address, telephone number, your credit or debit card number, bank account information, and other personal data. We also record the way you use our websites, apps, and social media channels, and we use this data to learn, for example, how many people visit our pages, and what they are trying to find. To find out more about how this works, please read our [Cookie policy](https://www.shakespearesglobe.com/policies/cookie-policy/) _._ We use your data to provide you with our services but also to promote, analyze and improve our services. For example, we use your data to send you booking information and help with any questions you may have, collect your payments, and to make your experience more enjoyable when you visit us in person or online. If you have opted-in to receive marketing messages from us, then we may use personal data such as your purchase history, location, as well as the preferences you selected when you created your account, to promote and tell you about related products and services that we think you might be interested in. ## Who else has access to your data. In order to provide you with our services, we employ the services of other organisations who process your data on our behalf. We call these organisations ‘Service Providers’, and they help us with things like payments, website hosting and development, data analysis, customer service, email, etc. We don’t allow our Service Providers to use your data for any purposes other than those described in this privacy notice, and we do not sell or rent information about you to other parties. At times, we may ask you for permission to share some of your data, such as your name and email address, with our co-production partners, associate companies and visiting artists to help them in developing their audiences. We will ask you if you wish to opt-in for your data to be shared with them when you buy a ticket for one of their performances. If you have opted-in, then our partners may contact you until you opt-out. You will be able to unsubscribe from their communications directly by following the instructions provided in their messages. Apart from our Service Providers, we may also use and share your data with other organisations as we believe necessary to comply with the law, to protect you, ourselves and others, to respond to requests from public and government authorities (which may include authorities outside your country of residence), or in the event of any reorganisation, sale, bankruptcy or other similar situations. ## Your rights over your data. You have the right to be informed about how we use your data. We cover all of the important points in this privacy notice but if you have any questions, then don’t hesitate to [email](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#036762776243706b62686670736662716670646f6c61662d606c6e). If you decide to give us permission to collect and use your data, then you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, because of how our systems work, this also means that we will no longer be able to offer you certain services such as online booking and shopping or access to our educational content or press materials. You can also request a copy or summary of the information that we hold about you, or ask us to correct any personal information you think is inaccurate. Your first request for information will be fulfilled free of charge but we will charge £10 for further requests or enquiries which we deem to be unfounded or excessive. The quickest way of requesting a summary of the data we hold about you is to complete a [Subject Access Request Form](https://cdn.shakespearesglobe.com/uploads/2019/03/3707_Access_Membership_scheme_form_final.pdf) _. _Please complete the form and return via [email](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7c181d081d3c0f141d17190f0c191d0e190f1b10131e19521f1311) or via post to the address listed on the form. You may ask us to delete the personal data we hold on you. We will consider your request and not reasonably refuse it. If we agree to your request, we will remove any information that identifies you as an individual. In both cases we may retain anonymised data (for example, your booking history) for business purposes. To make a request for any of the above, please [email](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f692978297b6859e979d9385869397849385919a999493d895999b). Please note: if you have an account on [Teach Shakespeare](http://teach.shakespearesglobe.com/), you can remove any data held on this site yourself. Log in to edit your profile, where you will be able to cancel your account. If you have opted-in to receive marketing-related communications (emails, post, SMS etc) then you have the right to stop us from contacting you for marketing purposes at any time. We may still send you important administrative messages needed to provide you with our services or in the event of changes, cancellations or other urgent situations which may inconvenience you if we were not to do so. If you no longer wish to be contacted for marketing purposes, please [log in/register](https://basket.shakespearesglobe.com/account/login ""Log in or Register with the Globe"") and update your preferences, or click ‘Unsubscribe’ at the bottom of our emails. Finally, if you are unhappy with how we are managing your personal data, or aren’t happy with our response, then you have the right to file a complaint with the [Information Commissioner’s Office](https://ico.org.uk/concerns/). ## When we need to keep your data. As a business, we also have a variety of obligations to keep the data that you provide us. These include ensuring that transactions are processed correctly, identifying fraud, and complying with any laws and rules that apply to us and to our service providers. For example, even if you close your Shakespeare’s Globe ticket account, we may keep certain data (such as sales, membership and donation information) to meet our obligations but for no longer than required or permitted by law. ## Transferring your data to other countries. Please note that your data may be stored and processed in any country in which our service providers operate, and we therefore may transfer your data to countries outside of your country of residence, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country. However, we will take measures to ensure that your data remains protected at all times to the standard imposed by the GDPR. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your personal data. ## Security. We use reasonable and modern measures to protect your personal data within our organisation but, unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system is 100% secure. If you feel that the security of your account or interaction with us has been compromised, please contact us immediately. ## Recruitment As part of any recruitment process, we collect personal data relating to job applicants. _Data Processing Policy (Recruitment)_ ## Contact us. **Data and Privacy Policy Enquiries** [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a8ccc9dcc986d8e8dbc0c9c3cddbd8cdc9dacddbcfc4c7cacd86cbc7c5) **General Enquiries** Telephone: +44 (0)20 7902 1400  Email: [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#98f1f6fef7d8ebf0f9f3fdebe8fdf9eafdebfff4f7fafdb6fbf7f5) **Address** 21 New Globe Walk  Bankside  London  SE1 9DT We endeavour to answer all data enquiries within 28 working days. _The Shakespeare Globe Trust_  _A Limited company registered in England and Wales No. 1152238_  _And a registered charity No. 266916_  _Shakespeare Globe Trading Limited registered in England and Wales No. 997433_","We collect and store a variety of data from you, depending on how you use our services.

"####Elephant Auto Insurance | Privacy & Security##Elephant Insurance Company (Elephant) collects customer information to help us to serve you better. We are committed to protecting your privacy by maintaining and using this information responsibly. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we collect, the use and disclosure of personal information we collect, as well as how we protect that information. By visiting our website or providing your information to us, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. By providing your telephone number, you authorize Elephant and its representatives to contact you at that number regarding the sale of insurance products and services. You agree that you may be contacted in person, by recorded message or by the use of automated dialing equipment. You are not required to provide your telephone number to receive a quote.##What information do you collect about me?##Elephant collects information about you to quote and service your insurance policy. The information we collect that identifies you is known as “nonpublic personal information” (NPPI), because it personally identifies you and is not otherwise available lawfully through a public information source. We commonly collect several types of this information from the following sources: ##Application Information: This is information provided by you, the consumer, on your application either by phone or online. We may also obtain it from outside sources. It includes your name, street address, phone number, e-mail address, driver’s license number, Social Security number, date of birth, gender, marital status, vehicle information, and information about other drivers.##It is vitally important that you inform us of any change to your application information in a timely manner. It not only allows us to ensure that we meet your changing insurance needs, but it assists us in protecting your privacy. It is especially important that you notify us about changes in your contact information, as we periodically may need to speak to you or send you information regarding your policy. To provide updates, please contact one of our customer service specialists at 1-877-218-7865. ##Consumer Report Information: We obtain this information from third party consumer reporting agencies. It includes your driving record, claims history with other insurers, and credit report information. Credit report information is used to develop an insurance score. This credit-based insurance score does not affect your financial credit score. The information is kept by the consumer reporting agencies and disclosed by them to others as permitted by law. Consumer reporting agencies may be contacted during underwriting, processing claims, investigations, to service your account, and other purposes as permitted by law.##Transaction information: This is information about your transactions with Elephant. It includes your insurance coverages, limits, rates, and payment and claims history. It also includes information that we require for billing and payment.##Website information: This information is unique to Internet transactions. It includes the website that linked you to ours, your computer operating system, and the pages you viewed on our site. Some websites, including ours, may also store “cookies” on your computer. Cookies collect technical data such as your Internet protocol (IP) address, operating system, and session ID. They may also save certain information entered by you.##Why do you ask for my e-mail address?##When you get a quote or purchase a policy, we collect your e-mail address so that we may send periodic emails to you of both promotional and transactional nature. If you no longer wish to receive promotional email communications from us, you may opt-out by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each communication or by contacting us at customerservice@elephant.com.##Notice of Financial Information Collection and Disclosure Practices##Elephant collects financial information in connection with insurance transactions. Financial information is any personal information about an individual other than medical information. This information is used to keep our rates competitive for customers. As part of the NPPI, financial information is collected and disclosed as described above. As described in this notice, this information is restricted and protected and is disclosed only when allowed by law. Examples of disclosures would include reporting information as permitted by law to a Consumer Reporting Agency, or information transmitted to a third party in connection to an insurance transaction. Furthermore, by agreements, these third parties will maintain the confidentiality of this information and not disclose it unless permitted by law.##How will you share this information about me?##Elephant reserves the right to disclose nonpublic personal information (NPPI) it collects to third parties. Without prior authorization, we will share information about you only as permitted by law. However, as permitted by law, disclosures of NPPI we have collected may be made to our affiliates and partners when deemed necessary to business operations. Disclosures may also lawfully be made to prevent, detect, or investigate criminal activity, fraud, and misrepresentation.##Disclosures of NPPI are made only when required to provide insurance claims or customer service, prevent fraud, perform research or comply with the law. Examples of potential recipients to whom your NPPI may be disclosed include: claims representatives, underwriters, service providers, consumer reporting agencies, other insurance agencies, law enforcement, and government agencies. These parties may disclose the information to others as permitted by law. For example, consumer reporting agencies may disclose transaction information received from us to other insurance companies with whom you do business.##How do you protect my information?##Elephant restricts access to your NPPI to our employees and others we feel must use it to provide our products and services. We require those individuals with access to your customer information to protect it and keep it confidential. Their use of the information is limited by law, our employee Code of Ethics, and written agreements where appropriate. We also maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable regulatory security standards to protect your information.##How can I opt out?##Elephant reserves the right to disclose NPPI to third parties. You have the opportunity to notify us at any time that you wish to opt out of the disclosures described in this Privacy Notice before any disclosure is made to a third party.

"####Multiply##Multiply is a web site that allows you to build and leverage your network of contacts in very powerful ways, via messaging and information sharing. The site is designed to facilitate communication, information sharing and introductions among people in the same network (i.e., your ""primary"" contacts such as friends, family members, co-workers, etc. as well as the extended group of people you are connected to through these primary contacts) and as such, encourages the disclosure of certain personal information by members to fully leverage its communications facilities. ##The disclosure of personal information is always a sensitive issue and Multiply takes it very seriously. We consider it our highest priority to protect the privacy of our members. To that end, this privacy policy outlines the types of information Multiply collects and how that information is used in the operation of our site. All information that Multiply collects will adhere to this privacy policy and will be used for the sole purpose of providing you a highly personalized and interactive experience with our site. No personal information collected from our members will ever be sold or leased to any third party without the proper consent.##Questions regarding this privacy policy should be sent via Multiply's Feedback page.##About the Information We Collect and How We Use it##1.Registration##To create your account as a registered Multiply member, we will require you to choose a member ID and password, and provide your e-mail address. We also may ask you to provide certain personal information, such as: first and last name, home country and zip/postal code, gender and birth date. Your ID is used to provide a unique account with which you can access Multiply and to create the web address (URL) for your home page: http://ID.multiply.com. As such, your ID will be visible to anyone who visits your Multiply home page. Your e-mail address is used to identify you in our system, to contact you in connection with your activities on the Site (including, but not limited to, confirmation e-mails or important news affecting your relationship with Multiply, as well as to gather feedback via surveys to enable us to improve our site according to your needs), and to forward messages to you from other Multiply members. Your first name, gender, zip/postal code, city, state and country may be viewable by other Multiply members. (For U.S. addresses the city and state are derived from the zip code.) You control whether other registered Multiply members can view your last name, e-mail address and age on your personal profile page, and you can limit access to specific groups of members (see Your Profile Page section below). Note that even if you restrict who can see your last name on your profile page, it may be displayed in some cases for people in your network; for example, your direct contacts, as well as members of any private groups you belong to, can always see it, and people who already know your last name can find you in searches by searching for your first and last name. Multiply will never share your personal information with any non-registered user of our site or third party company or person without your explicit consent. Note also that we require prospective members to confirm the e-mail address provided at registration, preventing someone from registering with another person's e-mail address.##2.Contacts' Information##Fundamental to the Multiply experience is building and interacting with your network of contacts. When you invite another person to register for our site and join your network, we will ask you to provide that person's e-mail address or Instant Messenger ID, and the nature of your relationship (e.g., brother, friend, co-worker, etc.) with that person. We use this information to categorize your contacts within your network and allow you to limit access to information/content by relationship category (i.e., you may post an update to your personal calendar and limit its access to ""family members."")##3.Groups##Another important feature of Multiply is your ability to create groups based on common interests, and invite contacts who share that interest to join your group. When you create a group, we may ask you to provide information to identify the group, such as a group name, a unique abbreviation and a brief description of the group. ##4.Your Profile Page##Your profile page will include information about yourself to enable other Multiply members to find your profile in searches, and invite you into their network. Information such as your first name, user ID, gender, city, state, or region, and postal code may be viewable by all Multiply members. If you choose to upload a headshot image, it may also be viewable by all Multiply members. You will choose which other demographic information appears on your Profile page, although your last name is always visible by your direct contacts. Profile information may include the following: occupation, home address, phone numbers, e-mail address(es), Instant Messenger IDs, personal interests and anything else you choose to share. Through the Profile page, you control the information displayed in your profile and, as a result, determine who can find you in searches for specific profile information (although anyone who knows your last name can search for it and find it, even if you restrict access to it).  Providing profile information is optional; however it enables Multiply members to better identify each other and more effectively connect and interact with their network. We may use demographic information to tailor the Site to your interests, and also may share demographic information with advertisers on an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers your identity). One of the reasons we may do this is to increase the likelihood that our advertisers' goods and services will appeal to Multiply's users, so that we may target specific ads at specific demographic groups. Our sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., we do not tell advertisers which particular Multiply users are members of which demographic groups), subject to the rest of this privacy policy. ##5.Cookies and Log Files##Like most web sites, Multiply uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer and allows Multiply to recognize you as a member when you return to our site using the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our website. Cookies also help us understand how members use Multiply, which allows us to continually improve the service. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site.##One type of cookie, known as a ""persistent"" cookie, is set when you log in to your Multiply account if you check the ""remember me on this computer"" box. The next time you visit the Multiply web site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing member so you will not need to log in before using the service. In order to change your e-mail address or password, however, you will need to re-enter your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie. Additionally, if you log out of the Multiply site you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a ""session"" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Multiply site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.##Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the Multiply web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave Multiply. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. Tracking technologies are used to gather statistical data on user conversions, including sales and registrations. This information may be used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Multiply service, but is not linked to personally identifiable information in any way.##6.Children##In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will not knowingly provide access to Multiply to persons under the age of thirteen (13). If Multiply later learns that a member is under the age of thirteen (13) we will take appropriate steps to remove the member's information from the database and restrict the individual from future access to the Multiply service.##With Whom Information May Be Shared##1.Third Parties##Multiply will not sell or lease your personal information to third parties without your explicit consent, unless required by law. We may share your information with third parties under certain circumstances:##if sharing your information is necessary to execute a specific request by you (e.g., purchasing premium services via credit card, in which case it would be necessary to share your information with a credit card processing company). In these specific cases third parties will not retain, share or store any personally identifiable information except to provide the specific services requested by you, and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.##if sharing your information is required by law or is necessary to respond to a subpoena, warrant or court order, or to protect the rights of Multiply or its members.##if you give us explicit permission to share your information for any reason not stated in this privacy policy.##2.Other Multiply Members##Occasionally you may invite a non-member of Multiply to register with the site and join your network or group. You also may invite existing Multiply members to join a group or become your direct contact. In these cases, Multiply generates an e-mail message to your invitee that may list information such as your e-mail address, your full name and your headshot photo (if you have provided one). The rest of your contact information will only be shared with the person you invite if both of you have indicated that you would like to establish each other as contacts. In addition, when you visit another Multiply member's home page, we may share with that member your User ID and headshot image, if you've provided one, as well as the date and time you visited the page.##3.Advertisers##We may use third-party advertising companies to advertise products or services on our site. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags will be completely anonymous. ##4.Links to Other Web Sites##You may occasionally see links to other web sites on Multiply, either via advertisements or other third-party promotions or links posted by other Multiply members. Multiply is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites you may visit through a link you found on Multiply. If you provide information directly to a party other than Multiply, different privacy policies may cover those parties' use of your information. Please review any company's privacy policy before disclosing your personal information. ##Security##Multiply has implemented security measures to protect member information from loss, misuse and alteration. We use industry-standard practices such as encrypted storage, firewalls and password protection systems to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information. Each of our employees is aware of our security policies, and your information is only available to those employees who need it to perform their jobs.##You Have Control Over Your Personal Information##The success of Multiply is directly related to your trust in our privacy practices. Although we encourage our members to share information to get the most benefit from the site, we also let you control the way certain personal information is displayed on the site. Although we provide powerful tools for you to share information, remember it is always your choice whether or not to share certain information with other Multiply members or the general public.##You can change any of your personal information stored on the Multiply site at any time, whether it be the information supplied at registration (with the exception of your user ID), for your profile page or anything else. You may change information in the Setup and Profile areas. In addition, you may cancel your Multiply membership by sending us an e-mail via our Contact page. Once we process your request, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our database.##Safe Shopping Policy##We use a variety of information security measures to protect your online transactions with us, including encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to protect your personal information during data transport. SSL protects information you submit via our Web site such as ordering information including your name, address and payment information. ##Changes to this Privacy Policy##Multiply may update our privacy policy. The latest version of the privacy policy will always be available at http://multiply.com/info/privacy. Please check this page occasionally to make sure you are aware of any updates.","Multiply is a web site that allows you to build and leverage your network of contacts in very powerful ways, via messaging and information sharing.

We use cookies to let us know that you are a prior customer, user or Member and to provide certain features to you. Most web browsers allow you to instruct the browser to prevent the use of cookies. However, if you disable this feature, certain aspects of the Services, such as the shopping basket, may not function properly. To manage Flash cookies, please click here: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html##We have relationships with third parties who may collect or receive information directly from the cookies placed by our Service on your computer to assist in analyzing our business and customers. ##Our Service may also use a common web technology called ""action tags"" (also called single pixel gifs or web beacons) to track purchase, usage and other web activity information. Action tags may be used to provide data to third parties for tracking purposes. In addition, third parties may set their own cookies and tags through our Service (such as through interest-based advertising, described below).

We collect data from you for use in interest-based advertising when you use our Service. Other companies may serve interest-based advertisements on our Service. We comply with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising as administered by the Digital Advertising Alliance ( aboutads.info).##Other Services. Advertisements for our products and services may appear on third party websites around the Internet. Some websites and services deliver these advertisements based upon data that has been previously collected about your past behavior online. For example, if you have viewed websites about gift baskets, these websites or services may display to you an advertisement for our gift baskets. This kind of targeted advertising is sometimes called interest-based or online behavioral advertising. It is generally not based upon your personal information (such as your name or email address), but rather, upon your online activities. We do not control such third party websites or services on which these advertisements appear. Further, we do not control how they collect and use data about your online activities. ##Consent. You may opt-out of being tracked online by certain companies who are listed ##at   www.aboutads.info/choices/  OR   www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp  and may also learn more about online behavioral advertising at such websites. If you opt-out, you will still receive generic advertisements, but they will not be delivered to you by such companies from whom you have opted out based upon your behavioral data possessed by the companies from whom you have opted-out. This process relies upon an opt-out cookie, for each browser and each device, so if you delete your cookies or use a different computer, you will have to repeat this process. We do not respond to or honor ""do not track"" (a/k/a DNT) signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers. #### D.     Push Notifications. ##As a user who has downloaded our Company’s mobile application, we may from time-to-time send you push notifications to your device in order to communicate with you and advise you of current offers and promotions.

We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.## HOW WE USE/SHARE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT ##We use information we collect to communicate with you, to process your orders, to improve our products and services (such as by responding to your feedback), to conduct research (such as statistics on favorite -- i.e., most ordered -- products), to provide an enhanced and more personalized shopping experience (for instance, to provide event reminders, such as birthdays), to inform you and your gift recipients of offers and discounts from the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM® family of brands and Company Affiliates, and to enable you to receive credits for purchases under loyalty or buying programs which you have joined. ##We may also use your information, as necessary or appropriate in our view, to operate the Service, process orders or registrations, to conduct promotions, contests, and sweepstakes you participate in.##We may combine information we receive from you via our Service with information from our Affiliates and third parties. We use the combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us (for example, by keeping your profile up-to-date) and to communicate with you in accordance with this Privacy Policy. ##In addition, as provided below, the Company may use or share your data with both affiliated and unrelated third parties, for the purposes so identified.    ## A.     Affiliate Data Sharing.  ##    We may provide your information to our Company Affiliates for use in connection with their businesses, including sending you offers and promotions.

"####Privacy Policy - AffiliateWP##Your privacy is very important to us. At AffiliateWP we have a few fundamental principles that we follow:####We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.##We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.##We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our site.####AffiliateWP LLC (“AffiliateWP”) operates several websites including AffiliateWP.com. It is AffiliateWP’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.##Website Visitors##Like most website operators, AffiliateWP collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. AffiliateWP’ purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how AffiliateWP’ visitors use its website. From time to time, AffiliateWP may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.##AffiliateWP also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our blogs. AffiliateWP only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.##Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information##Certain visitors to AffiliateWP’ websites choose to interact with AffiliateWP in ways that require AffiliateWP to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that AffiliateWP gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who comment on our blog to provide a username and email address. Those who wish to receive AffiliateWP updates via email, we collect their emails. In each case, AffiliateWP collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with AffiliateWP. AffiliateWP does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.##Aggregated Statistics##AffiliateWP may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, AffiliateWP may monitor the most popular pages on the AffiliateWP.com site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. AffiliateWP may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, AffiliateWP does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.##Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information##AffiliateWP discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on AffiliateWP’s behalf or to provide services available at AffiliateWP’ websites, and (ii) have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using AffiliateWP’ websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. AffiliateWP will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, AffiliateWP discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when AffiliateWP believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of AffiliateWP, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an AffiliateWP website and have supplied your email address, AffiliateWP may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with AffiliateWP and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.

" Please check the original snapshot on the Wayback Machine for the most accurate reproduction.  Yummly: Personalized Recipe Recommendations and Search Effective as of 8/21/19 Welcome! Yummly is an online platform that provides users with a collaborative space to find, discuss and share information about all things food, and take advantage of other food- and cooking-related features, through the Yummly website (the "" Site "") and/or a Yummly mobile application (the "" App "") (collectively, our "" Services ""). Yummly, Inc. ("" Yummly ""), a subsidiary of Whirlpool Corporation, provides this Privacy Notice to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data and other data when you use our Services. For purposes of the European General Data Protection Regulation No. 679/2016 ("" GDPR "") and similar data protection laws, Yummly processes your Personal Data as a data controller.  Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Notice, terms used in this Privacy Notice have the same meanings as in our Terms of Use.  As used in this Privacy Notice, the terms "" using "" and "" processing "" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis, and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.  Summary Information Collection and Use We collect (1) Personal Data that you have voluntarily shared with us; (2) data concerning your activity when using the Services; and (3) data you provide or that is otherwise collected through other sources. We use your Personal Data to provide you with the Services, respond to your requests, and enable you to interact with our Services.  Legal Basis for Processing We process your Personal Data to satisfy our contractual obligations to you; based on your consent; to protect the legitimate interests of Yummly or third parties; or to comply with legal obligations.  Data Retention We use your Personal Data for as long as is necessary to achieve the intended purpose.  Information Shared with Others Your data may be shared (1) with other users; (2) with service providers; (3) with other third-party apps and services; (4) to comply with the law; (5) with other Whirlpool entities; or (6) in connection with a sale or reorganization of our business.  International Transfers We take measures to protect your data when we transfer it to another country.  EU-U.S. Privacy Shield And Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield If you are a resident of Europe, special protections apply when we transfer your data to the United States.  Managing Your Data You can access, integrate, update, amend and delete your Personal Data.  Your California Privacy Rights We do not share your Personal Data with third parties for their own marketing purposes unless you consent to such sharing.  Interest-Based Advertising/Your Choices You can opt-out of seeing personalized ads.  Security The security of your data is important to us so we have implemented measures designed to safeguard your Personal Data against loss, theft, and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.  Links to Other Sites We may link to other sites, but we are not responsible for their practices.  Our Policy Toward Children We do not knowingly collect data from children under age 13.  Amendments and Updates We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time.  CONTACT US You can contact us by sending us an email at privacy@yummly.com or using the information provided in the ""Contact Us"" section below.  1. Information Collection and Use Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services and to enable our users to enjoy and easily navigate our Services. To provide you with a consistent user experience and to recognize you as a user across our Services, we may collect and combine data as described below; for example, data collected when you visit the Site or the App from one browser or device may be combined or linked with data collected when you visit the Site or App from a different browser or device.  Generally, we collect two types of information: Personal Data and Other Information. Personal Data is information that can be used to identify you as an individual. Other Information is information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to you as an identifiable individual, including information that has been de-identified, aggregated with data from other users, or anonymized so that it doesn't reveal who you are.  Personal Data. When you use the Services, we may collect the following Personal Data:   Your contact information, such as your first and last name, email address, mailing address, and phone number;  Your billing information, such as your credit card number and billing address;  Your Yummly account information, including your user name, account number, and your encrypted Yummly password;  Product and ownership information about your kitchen appliances and accessories, including those that are capable of working with the Yummly app (for example, if you use the App to remotely control a kitchen appliance, we will collect information from the appliance manufacturer that we need to make the App work);  Information you voluntarily provide about yourself, such as allergies, dietary restrictions, food preferences, and groceries that you want to purchase;  Your preferences, such as product wish lists, food and recipe preferences, kitchen appliance or accessory preferences, order history, and marketing preferences;  Your user content (including video and images) you provide to use certain features, including recipes you submit, and information you provide so that we can help you manage your grocery inventory (such as photographs or video you provide to facilitate ingredient recognition features); and  Your mobile device model and ID number, user settings, location (if you enable this feature), and information about your use of the App when applicable.  Your Personal Data is processed only to the extent necessary to pursue the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice. To learn about how long Yummly keeps your Personal Data, see Section 3, Data Retention.  When we ask you to provide us with your Personal Data, you can decline, but many of our services and features require some Personal Data. If you choose not to provide the necessary Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain services or features. If you choose not to share your Personal Data, features that require personalization will not work for you.  Third Party Services. If you create a Yummly Account using your login from a third party service (including a social media network such as Facebook), we will access and collect the information about you that your privacy settings on that third party service permit so that we can create an Account for you. Also, we may collect information that you make available to Whirlpool or other manufacturers of kitchen appliances and accessories (like information about your appliance to allow us to send cooking times and temperatures to the appliance ) if this is related to providing the Services to you.  Use of Personal Data. We use your Personal Data mainly to provide our Services and administer your inquiries. For example, when you create an Account through the Services and become a Registered User or when you choose to create your own profile, we may ask you for Personal Data so we can create your account or populate your profile (see ""Registered Users"" below). We may also use your Personal Data to update our Services or features, troubleshoot or provide support to you.  We also use your Personal Data to improve and develop our products, personalize our products, make recommendations to you, and send you relevant offers. We may also use your Personal Data to send you Yummly newsletters, marketing or promotional materials, or other information that may be of interest to you. Where required, we will obtain your consent to send you these communications. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive them, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your user preferences information.  _Registered Users. _Once you become a Registered User, you will be able to create a profile page by submitting certain Personal Data. The profile page will display your profile name as well as your profile picture, if you choose to upload one or agree to allow a Third-party service (like Facebook) to provide one for you. You can choose what other Personal Data you provide as part of your profile. Providing such information is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with Yummly and its users.  _Other Information. _We collect Other Information that you provide as part of the registration process, when you personalize your profile page, when you set your individual preferences (such as your viewing and/or food preferences), and as you use the Services. We also collect Other Information from you when we administer your account or respond to your inquiries. Certain Other Information will be considered Personal Data if it is combined with other data in such a way that enables you to be identified. However, where Other Information is taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences) it will not be treated as Personal Data.  We may combine your Personal Data with Other Information and aggregate it with information collected from other users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze and understand how our Services are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically – for instance, to deliver information to you according to your preferences or restrictions.  _Usage Information. _ When you visit or use the Services or use a Yummly website or mobile application that has Yummly features (like the Yum button), our servers automatically record information that your browser or mobile device sends or transmits ( Usage Information ). This Usage Information may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site or the App that you visit (or of the site you visited that had the Yummly feature), the time spent on those pages, information you search for, access times and dates, the model and device ID number of your mobile device, user settings, location (if you enable this feature), and statistics and information about your use of the Site and App. We use this information to provide and improve the Services, develop new products, and offer products and services that may be of interest to you. We also use Usage Information to monitor and analyze use of the Services, for technical administration, to improve functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Services to our visitors' needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you revisit the Services, we will recognize you and can serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. Some of the Usage Information (like your IP address) is Personal Data, but we don't use it to identify you.  Cookies. Like many websites, we use cookies , pixels, web beacons, APIs and similar technologies to collect Usage Information. Pixels and web beacons are small pieces of code placed on web pages and content that communicate when the page or content has been viewed. A cookie is a small data file that your browser places on your computer that helps us understand how you interact with the Site and use our Services. We use two types of cookies. We use persistent cookies to save information like your search preferences, your Account settings and login information, so that we can remember you and your settings when you return to the Site or App, and personalize your experience. We use session cookies to enable certain features of our Services, but unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you leave or log off and/or when you close your browser. Third-party advertisers on the Site or in the App may also place or read cookies on your browser. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies but you can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of or all functionality of our Services.  We also use third parties (including Google Analytics and Mixpanel) to provide usage analytics for our Services. These third parties will place their own cookies to collect traffic and activity data in order to deliver us relevant metrics and information. We do not share any Personal Data of our users with these parties, but we may share anonymized or aggregated information with them to help improve our Services. The collection of this data by these third parties is subject to their own privacy notices. For more information visit: Google Analytics and Mixpanel.  2. Legal Basis for Processing Below is an explanation of the different legal grounds we have for processing your information:   To satisfy our contractual obligation to you. For example: allowing you to register for an Account; providing the Services to you; assisting you with pairing a kitchen appliance or accessory through the Services; and fulfilling your product orders and providing additional services (for example, delivery, after-sale services, and the management of returns). With your consent. For example: processing health information, such as information about your allergies, so that we can customize our recommendations for you; processing your entry into a prize promotion/competition; sending you customized marketing communications related to our products and services electronically (including email, notifications from third party services, and notifications from mobile applications); and sharing your Personal Data for customized marketing communication with our selected trusted partners with your consent. When we have a legitimate business interest to do so. For example: managing the requests for information you send us, including handling complaints; preventing fraud; enforcing our rights before the courts; improving the performance and security of our products and our Services, including the App and the Site; sending you customer care communications concerning products or services you have used or which you showed interest in, and in order to carry out customer satisfaction surveys; unless you opt-out, contacting you for marketing purposes by phone (non-automated) and via paper mail; and carrying out activities useful for the transfers of business and business branches, takeovers, mergers, demergers or other transformations and for the execution of such transactions. We may also use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations.      If you do not want Yummly to use your electronic contact details for marketing purposes, you can always follow the instructions to ""unsubscribe"" in our emails; or in accordance with Section 14 of this Privacy Notice below.  3. Data Retention Yummly will process your Personal Data for as long as it is necessary to achieve the purposes described above. In any case, the following retention periods generally apply:   If you delete your account we have processes designed to delete your Personal Data within approximately one month. If you do not use your account or receive emails from us for an extended period of time (generally up to two and one-half years), we will delete your Personal Data.  While this represents our general policy, keep in mind that we will retain information to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect fees, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with investigations, enforce our agreements, and take other actions permitted by law.  We do not share your Personal Data, except as described in this Privacy Notice. Through the Services, you are able to share your Personal Data when you share something through our Service (like when you use the Yum button), when you give us your consent to do so (like when we notify you that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide us with such information), when you share Personal Data with a third party service (if you allow such sharing), or when you share Personal Data with your friends with whom you want to connect (according to the preferences you have set in your Account).  We may share Other Information, such as de-identified data and Usage Information, with third parties.  Your Personal Data is shared with:  Whirlpool Brands and Entities. Yummly is a subsidiary of Whirlpool Corporation. Any data, including Personal Data collected by Yummly, may also be shared with Whirlpool Corporation or its brands (including but not limited to Whirlpool®, Maytag®, KitchenAid®, Jenn-Air®, Amana®, EveryDrop®, and Affresh®) and subsidiaries located in the European Economic Area ( EEA ) and outside of the EEA, acting as autonomous controllers (e.g., Whirlpool Canada LP, Whirlpool EMEA S.p.A., Whirlpool UK Appliance Limited), who may use the information for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice. A more complete list of Whirlpool Corporation's brands and subsidiaries can be found by browsing https://whirlpoolcorp.com. All of these brands and entities are referred to within this Notice collectively as ""Whirlpool.""  Other Users. When you post comments or content (such as reviews or recipes) on any Yummly message boards or blogs, or when you use other interactive features (such as when you connect with friends) made available through or in connection with the Services, any data you choose to include will be accessible to other users. We urge you to be very careful when deciding to make any of your Personal Data, or any Other Information, publicly available through the Services. If you choose to use any social network features such as the Facebook ""Like"" button and other widgets, such as a ""share"" button or interactive mini-programs that we may offer through the Services, these features may collect your IP address and information about which page you are visiting on our Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statements of the companies providing them.  _Service Providers. _We may share any of your data with third party companies and individuals we engage to facilitate our Services, to provide services to us or on our behalf, to perform related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of our features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used. We also share information about your use of Yummly products that does not personally identify you with service providers that store this information to improve the Services. If service providers have access to your Personal Data, we require them to use it only to perform tasks on our behalf and not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.  Other Third-Party Apps and Services. You can choose to integrate our App with a variety of third-party apps and services. If you do, we will share information with, and receive information from, the relevant third party to the extent necessary for the integration to work properly. For example:   If you use our App with your compatible connected kitchen appliance or accessory, we may exchange information like cooking times and temperatures with the manufacturer.  If you use our App with compatible services or retailers, such as grocery stores, grocery delivery, or food delivery services, we may exchange information about your geographic location, food preferences, and ingredient choices.  If you authorize our App to connect with Apple Health or a similar app, we may share nutritional information about certain recipes with the app to help you accommodate food preferences or allergies.  Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. __ In certain situations, Yummly may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Yummly cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Yummly or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.  Business Transfers. __ Yummly may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Data, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.  5. International Transfers The Services are offered globally so it is necessary to transfer your information internationally. In particular, your information will be transferred to and processed in the United States where our servers are located. The data protection and other laws of other countries, such as the United States, may not be as comprehensive as those in your country. We rely on multiple legal bases to lawfully transfer Personal Data internationally. These include your consent, EU Commission approved model contractual clauses (which require certain privacy and security protections), and the Privacy Shield Frameworks described below.  6. EU-U.S. Privacy Shield And Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Yummly, through Whirlpool Corporation, participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks. Yummly is committed to subjecting all Personal Data received from EU member countries and Switzerland in reliance on the Privacy Shield Frameworks to the Frameworks' applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield List https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.  Yummly is responsible for the processing of Personal Data it receives under the Privacy Shield Frameworks and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Yummly complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of Personal Data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S., including the onward transfer liability provisions.  With respect to Personal Data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Yummly is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern related to the Privacy Shield Framework that you believe we have not addressed satisfactorily, you may contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.  Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.   7. Managing Your Data We give you options to help you understand what Personal Data we use and to request that we change how we use it. At any time, you may contact us to:   be informed on the purposes and methods of the processing of your Personal Data;  access your Personal Data (commonly known as making a ""data subject access request""). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you;  ask for updating or rectification of the Personal Data we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us;  request erasure of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You can also ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have successfully objected to processing or where we are required to erase your Personal Data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be communicated to you, if applicable, at the time of your request;  restrict the processing of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it;  object to the processing, wholly or partly, of your Personal Data where we are relying on legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms;  where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data, you can revoke the consent to the processing of your Personal Data freely and at any time, also by clicking on the unsubscribe option at the bottom of our marketing communications; or  make your Personal Data available to you or to a different provider in some circumstances. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that Personal Data we process based on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) may not be portable.   If you wish to manage your data as described above, or raise any questions about the Personal Data we hold about you, please send an email to privacy@yummly.com or write us:  Chief Data Officer Yummly, Inc. 3101 Park Blvd Palo Alto, CA 94306 We respond to general privacy inquiries within 30 days. We process opt-out requests within 10 business days.  There is generally no charge for you to exercise any of the data management options described in this section, but we may charge a reasonable fee if you make excessive or unfounded requests. In some cases, depending on where you live, you have the right to lodge a complaint in front of the competent national data protection or judicial authority if you object to how we use your Personal Data.  8. Your California Privacy Rights We do not share your Personal Data with third parties for their own marketing purposes unless you consent to such sharing.  9. Interest-Based Advertising/Your Choices As described above, we and other parties we do business with (including advertisers on the Site), may place or recognize unique cookies or other technologies on your browser or device when you visit the Site or use the App. In addition to the uses above, these technologies enable the collection of information about online activities over time and across different websites and apps, which can be used to customize advertisements to you as you browse the Internet. In accordance with the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising, you can opt-out of having information regarding your online behavior collected and used for advertising purposes. To learn more about interest-based advertising, or to opt out for your web browser, please visit optout.aboutads.info or optout.networkadvertising.org; to opt out for mobile apps, please visit aboutads.info/appchoices. You may also be able to configure your mobile device privacy or advertising settings to limit the collection or use of data for advertising. Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt-out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However, the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests.  _Do Not Track. _Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a ""do not track"" setting; however, our Services do not respond to ""do not track"" signals at this time.  10. Security Yummly is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access; however, despite these efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.  If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the ""Contact Us"" section below.  11. Links to Other Sites Our Services may contain links to other websites, apps, and platforms. If you click on an ad or another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website, app, or platform. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit Personal Data from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the Personal Data you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit. This Privacy Notice does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties.  12. Our Policy Toward Children Our Service is not directed to children and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from a child under 13 (or any other age specified by applicable law), we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.  13. Amendments and Updates From time to time, we may update this Privacy Notice. Please take a look at the ""Last Updated"" field at the top of this page to see when this Privacy Notice was last revised. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this website prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.  Your use of the Website following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Notice.

Additionally, you should be aware that any information provided to third parties prior to your election to opt-out or unsubscribe cannot be retrieved or rescinded by us unless required by applicable law, and you cannot retroactively opt-out or unsubscribe with respect to such third parties.##Please note that in order to keep you informed about the operation of our Services and related services, we may always send you emails and announcements that are needed for the proper functioning and administration of our Services, including for the purposes described in Section 3 above, in connection with your use of such Services. We may also have features that allow you to submit information, questions or feedback to us. In those instances, we may retain your emails and other information you submit to us for our internal purposes, and to help us to serve you better.##Privacy Preferences.

Therefore, it is not clear whether the signals are intentionally transmitted by a user, or whether a user is even aware of this. Despite current efforts, there is still disagreement amongst leading Internet standards organizations, industry groups, technology companies and regulators, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals and no standard has been adopted to date. FRIENDS OF ANDREW YANG takes privacy and security very seriously. With respect to “do not track signals,” we currently do not take action in response to these signals, but if a standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.####SHARING AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT.##Disclosure to Third Parties.

If you do not accept these terms, you have no right to visit this site and you are fraudulently using this site. **A NOTE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS (ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT OF 2003 --OPPA)** It is the intent of the Privacy Policy to comply with the California Act.  Various provisions throughout this Privacy Policy address requirements of the act.  In summary, you must presume that we collect electronic information from all visitors.  This is not usually personally identifiable.  If you purchase a product or service via this website (and thereby become covered by the Act), the purchase agreement you electronically sign prior to purchase allows the website to collect and archive all the personal information you provide and to transmit and/or transfer that personal information to third parties.  There is no way you can modify this information and you have no right to do so.  Under the terms of the purchase agreement, you have no right to view or receive any information about our database.

This information is obtained in various ways, such as: **VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 'REGISTRATION'** Registration means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active, positive steps to communicate information to this website.  This can include pages or 'pop ups' where you register for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; it can include your participation in visitor surveys; it can include requesting information from the website via email, mail, or courier; it may be from joining an affiliate program or other membership organization, paid or unpaid; it may be from ordering a product. Occasionally complete credit card information may be provided to the website via fax or a fill-in form rather than regular secure merchant service processing.  This information is kept at the highest level of security and is never divulged to anyone except the merchant service provider or for the purpose of communication with the customer. **ONLINE ORDERING** Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping cart services supporting merchant service companies like Visa and Master Card provides information to the website but does not provide complete credit card numbers.  In the process of online ordering, the customer provides, name, address, city, state, email address, phone number, CVV2 (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member password.  You should consider all this information available to the website.  This information is used to deliver the product, but under the Purchase Agreement you also approve its use for general solicitation purposes. **VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES** Website visitors who wish to communicate with the website do so under two conditions:  one, they give their permission for contact by the website; two, they are subject to any ‘submission’ provisions of the Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement, or this Privacy Policy.  While your email address may or may not be used to solicit you, it is added to the website's general solicitation database. **CUSTOMER EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS** If you are a customer and send an email to the website, or if you communicate with the site by phone or mail, the website collects information about your communication and by communicating with the site you give your permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and otherwise use any information collected as the site sees fit.

Because we collect certain types of information about you when you visit our blogs, we have written this Privacy Policy to share our practices and use of that information. ### Types of Information We Collect: **– Anonymous Information**  We collect anonymous information from our visitors that cannot be associated with a specific individual. For example, we know how many people visit BoardingArea, but we don’t know their names or any other personal information about them. We collect this type of anonymous data in order to track overall Web site traffic and the specific pages that people visit most often. This anonymous tracking information is used to build a better service and enhance the content in our most popular blogs. Some of this anonymous tracking information is shared with third parties such as advertisers, but again, it remains anonymous. **– Comment Information**  Individual blogs store the comments you leave on their blog when responding to a bloggers post if we are hosting that blog. This information is yours, and is never used by BoardingArea for purposes other than what you intended. Just remember which blog you left a comment on, BoardingArea itself does not have any comment areas. **– Personal Information (application in becoming a blogger on BoardingArea only)**  We collect personal information if you voluntarily join the family of BoardingArea bloggers. Registration is required to access some of the features of this service. The only personal information collected upon signing up for a hosted blog is a working email address. **– The Way We Use Information (application to become a blogger only)**  We use your email address to send a confirmation email when you sign up for a hosted blog or when you choose to participate in the private bloggers only forum and to allow you to reset your password if you lose or forget your old one. We will also send you a notice to let you know if your blog has been accepted or declined. And finally, our administrators might send you an email if circumstances warrant it. No other use is now or ever will be made of this email address. We will not send you any other email unless you contact us first and specifically request information, technical help, or administrative assistance. We do not sell this address, or link it to any other personal information. **– Our Commitment To Data Security**  To prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative procedures to safeguard and secure any information (which is very, very limited) we collect online. **– Cookies**  Occasionally BoardingArea or its advertisers and/or sponsors may need to place a “cookie” on your computer or in our emails/communications. A cookie can serve many purposes such as a history of your previous visits to BoardingArea or your screen name, email and URL if you decided to leave a comment on a blog post. Cookies do not usually create any problems for you or your computer and are generally silent bystanders. They are primarily used to create a unique user experience for you on BoardingArea and in an age of personalization—to deliver more relevant advertising to you only via **nonpersonal information** that this cookie and your other cookies may offer. **You are free to delete this cookie at any time and you can elect to refuse cookies and/or delete cookies at any time in the future.** If you choose to do so, any information that was collected on past visits to BoardingArea will not be stored. **The choice is always yours, and we in no way discourage you from taking your privacy into your own hands and in fact encourage it.** To learn more about interest-based advertising in general and to opt out, please visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices.](https://app.grooveapp.com/url/qhc4aywsry3t1mhw1wfwh/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hYm91dGFkcy5pbmZvL2Nob2ljZXM%3D) ### Links to Other Sites BoardingArea contains content links to blogs—that’s the ‘network’. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of any of these blogs as they retain and have their own complete ownership of the content you read there. BoardingArea owns no content. **– Surveys or Contests**  From time to time we sponsor surveys and contests. If you participate, the sponsor typically will request certain Personal Information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you will have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Contest information typically includes information such as name and mailing address. If we are directly involved, we only use this information internally to determine eligibility, notify contest winners, and to measure the success of our efforts. Absolutely nothing else. **– Changes in this Privacy Statement**  While we don’t anticipate any changes in our privacy policy, there is always a possibility of change. If there is any substantial change to our policy, we will post those changes on pages we deem appropriate so that you are aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. This policy was last modified on February 1, 2019. **– Contacting BoardingArea**  If you have additional questions, please contact us by email at [privacy@boardingarea.com](mailto:privacy@boardingarea.com), or write to us at:  **BoardingArea**  415 E. Pikes Peak Avenue #101  Colorado Springs.

According to Section 3, Subsection 1 of the German Federal Data Protection Act (""Bundesdatenschutzgesetz""), these are individual details on personal or objective circumstances of a certain person or certain persons. These include details such as your name, your postal address, your email address, your telephone number or, where appropriate, even use-data. Collection and Use of Data Automated Data Collection When you access 6Wunderkinder websites, your internet browser automatically transmits data for technical reasons. The following data are stored separately from other data that you may have sent us:  your date and time of access, your browser-type and version, the operating system you use, the URL of the website you have previously visited, the quantity of data transmitted.  For technical reasons these data are stored and are not assigned to any identifiable person at any time. Data Entered by Users You can use the Wunderlist product both with and without registering. However, you can only access Wunderlist using certain terminals such as an iPhone, iPod, iPad, Windows, Mac or Android and without additional functions. In order to make use of all its advantages, you have to register. To do this, you must enter your email address and select a password. We require these data in order to guarantee that you are able to make full use of our entire offer. We need these and possibly other data not least in order to respond to your wishes, questions and criticism. In future, we plan to introduce an option which will allow you to design your account personally. For example, you will be able to add a photo, choose a username and set up a connection to your Facebook user account. You will not be obliged to design your account personally; this will be entirely voluntary. The central function of Wunderlist product is task management. You will be able to use this product both online and offline. Where Wunderlist is used solely offline, the data you enter will be stored de-centrally on your storage medium. In such a case, we will not be able to access these data. If you use Wunderlist in combination with a registered account, all data and tasks entered will be integrated into a database. The purpose of this database is to allow you to use Wunderlist at various different levels and call up your tasks anywhere and at any time. Data are transmitted to the respective terminal using SSL encryption so that your data are transmitted securely. We use personal data in order to enable secure, effective and user-related use of Wunderlist services, including for:  calling up the task-list via the internet; anonymously analysing task management statistics for press releases by 6Wunderkinder and studies; recommending Wunderlist by using the ""Invite"" function for friends and acquaintances (email address).  Transfer of Data We will not transfer your data to third parties as a matter of course without letting you know in advance or asking for your prior permission. We may only transfer your data to third parties without informing you separately beforehand in the following exceptional cases as explained below:  If required for investigating the illegal use of Wunderlist or for legal proceedings, personal data will be transferred to the criminal investigation authorities and, if appropriate, to injured third parties. We will only do this if there are concrete indications of illegal and/or abusive behaviour. We can only transfer on your personal data if this is used to enforce General Terms and Conditions of Business or other agreements. We are also legally obliged to give certain public authorities information. These are criminal investigation authorities, public authorities which prosecute administrative offences entailing fines and the German finance authorities. Occasionally we depend on contractually affiliated external companies and external service providers to supply services such as the supply of advertising measures (only if you have given your explicit prior consent), processing payments (PayPal, credit card etc.), storing your data and customer service. In such cases, information is transferred to these companies or individuals in order to enable them to process this information further. We carefully select these external service providers and review them regularly to ensure that your privacy is preserved. The service providers may only use the data for the purposes stipulated by us. We also contractually require the service providers to treat your data solely in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the German data protection laws. In order to further develop our business, we may alter the corporate structure of 6Wunderkinder GmbH by changing its legal form. We may also form, sell or buy subsidiaries, divisions or parts of the company. In such transactions, customer information together with the part of the company to be transferred will be passed on. Every time personal data are transferred to third parties to the extent prescribed, 6Wunderkinder will ensure that this is done in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the relevant data protection laws.  Newsletter 6Wunderkinder provides a newsletter service free of charge. We use the newsletter to inform you about new products and send you general information about 6Wunderkinder. We need your email address in order to send you the newsletter. You can enter your email address on 6Wunderkinder\'s start page, which is available at http://www.6wunderkinder.com. We will store and use your email address solely to send you the newsletter. Of course you can unsubscribe the newsletter at any time.

""Cookies"" are small files which are stored on your computer with the help of the internet browser. If you do not want to use ""cookies"", you can prevent ""cookies"" from being stored on your computer using the corresponding settings on your internet browser. Please note that this may restrict the functional capability and the range of functions of our offer. We use cookies and similar technologies for several purposes, including:  Storing your Preferences and Settings. Settings that enable our websites to operate correctly or that maintain your preferences over time may be stored on your device. Sign-in and Authentication. When you sign into a website, we store a unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your device. This cookie allows you to move from page to page within the site without having to sign in again on each page. Security. We use cookies to detect fraud and abuse of our websites. Analytics.

For example, we use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service and to develop other statistics about the operations of our products. This includes cookies from 6Wunderkinder and from third-party analytics providers. Performance. 6Wunderkinder uses cookies for load balancing to ensure that our websites remain up and running.  In addition to the cookies 6Wunderkinder sets when you visit our websites, third parties may also set cookies when you visit Microsoft sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics, support, and the collection of feedback. See, e.g., Google Analytics section below. Because your browser connects to those third parties\' web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services. Analysis of Wunderlist Statistical Data When Wunderlist is used, we collect statistical data which can be traced to you. We use it to improve Wunderlist. Google Analytics 6Wunderkinder uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (""Google""). Google Analytics uses so-called ""cookies"", text files which are stored on your computer and which enable you to analyse your use of Wunderlist. The information generated by the cookie on your use of Wunderlist (including your abbreviated IP address) is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and are stored there. Google will use this information to assess your use of Wunderlist, to compile reports on the activities for us and to provide more services connected with use of Wunderlist and the internet. It is also possible that Google may transmit this information to third parties if this is prescribed by law or if third parties process this information on behalf of Google. You can deactivate Google Analytics by means of a browser add-on if you do not want Wunderlist analysis. You can download this here: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de Deleting Your Data If your data are no longer required for the aforementioned purposes, we will delete them. Completed tasks will remain stored and will be marked ""Completed"" in the database. If you delete your account, we will also delete all data completely from your account (lists, tasks and shared lists). Data you have entered in lists belonging to third parties will remain in existence as these are part of third party accounts. If data has to be retained for statutory reasons, these will be blocked and will then no longer be available for any further use.

"This privacy policy covers how we treat personal information that we collect and receive. We do not intend to collect any personal information from children under 13 unless we believe such collection to be permitted by law. Please see below for our policy with respect to children under 13.  **General** We gather user information to provide you with a customized experience on our site. Your user information helps us tailor the content, services, goods and advertising to your current and future needs. For this reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal information when you post comments, enter a contest, order products, subscribe to a newsletter and/or visit certain areas of our site. If you choose not to register you may not have access to areas that require personal identification.  If you register with our site or purchase products from us, from time to time we may e-mail you with messages about our services or third party products and services we believe may be of interest to you, such as new products, features, services, special offers and updated information. The newsletters may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the newsletters, including whether the e-mail was opened and/or what links (if any) were clicked. We will combine that information with other information we have about you and may use that information to improve your site experience and/or provide customized e-mail communications to you. In addition, if you register with our site or purchase products you may automatically receive e-mails confirming your registration and/or purchase and providing you with necessary information relating to the access or use of your registration and/or purchase. With the exception of the e-mails described in the preceding sentence which are necessary to provide customer support and deliver products and services to you, you may opt-out of receiving e-mail from us as described below.  **Use of Information** When you register, we ask for your e-mail address, a unique nickname selected by you and other information. Once you are a registered user you can update your profile and may be able to provide additional preferential information.  For contests, we collect information from users in order to register them for the contest and to provide for payment. We may use an order form for users to request information, products and services. For that order form, we collect a user's contact information (e-mail address) and necessary financial information to process the order (i.e. credit card number). Contact information from the order (including e-mail) may be used to deliver digital products and information. We may use third parties to accept and process orders and credit card purchases for merchandise and products, including software.  We may occasionally present a special contest or promotion that is sponsored by another company. To qualify for entry in that contest or promotion, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share that information with the sponsor(s) or with others, we will provide a statement to that effect in the contest or promotion terms.  All communication on the Internet takes place between pairs of IP Addresses. Our Web servers will log the IP address that any connection is made from. We may use these IP addresses to help diagnose technical problems or prevent abuse of our systems or other site users. Your IP address may also be used to gather aggregate demographic data and target advertisements accordingly.  Your browser has options to accept, reject, or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent. A ""cookie"" is a small line of text that is stored with your Web browser for record-keeping purposes and to help us provide better service to you. We use cookies to save your password (in an encrypted format) on your machine so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and track your downloads and purchases from our site.  We use companies [Google ([www.google.com](http://www.google.com/)), Tribal Fusion ([www.tribalfusion.com](http://www.tribalfusion.com/)), Fastclick ([www.fastclick.com](http://www.fastclick.com/)), 24/7 Real Media ([www.realmedia.com](http://www.realmedia.com/)), RightMedia ([www.rightmedia.com](http://www.rightmedia.com/)), BudsInc ([www.budsinc.com](http://www.budsinc.com/)) ImpressionUp ([www.impressionup.com](http://www.impressionup.com/)) and AdBrite ([www.AdBrite.com](http://www.adbrite.com/))] to serve the advertisements on some of our pages. These companies and advertisers may place and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours. We may use your information or allow advertisers or companies that serve advertisements access to your information to determine which advertisements you will see. This information may include your demographic information, geographic location, what content you access on our site, how you rate various content, language contained in your comments and other information.  Our site contains links, including banner and other ads, to other Websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Websites. Our site may also link to Websites that feature our trademarks and names along with trademarks and names of other companies. You should look at the privacy policy on that co-branded Website, as the co-branded Website may not be under our control.  Applications you use or download from our site may contain third party digital rights management systems ('DRMS') which may allow for communication between your software and the third party and utilize security features (e.g., preventing distribution of or access to the applications in the event of unauthorized use). These DRMS are subject to their own license agreements and you agree that we shall not be responsible for any loss or damage of any sort relating to the use of the DRMS or your dealings with such third parties. The applications may also contain DRMS produced by us which allow for communication between the applications you use or download and our systems and which collect information describing your computer system in order to prevent illegal or unauthorized use of the applications.  For reasons such as improving member experience and providing customized communications to our users, we may receive information about you from third party sources and our web logs and add it to the information that we have received from you. Web logs automatically record anything a web server sees, which may include e-mail addresses you enter into a form or pages viewed by a user at a particular IP address.  **Information Sharing** We will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties, aside from entities that perform services for us, such as fulfilling orders or processing payment, that either are bound to comply with our privacy policy or have privacy policies that protect your information unless you have ""opted-in"" to such sharing. If you have previously opted-in to such sharing under a prior privacy policy version, you are still considered to have opted-in under this privacy policy. As stated, and whether or not you have opted-in, we may use third parties to accept and process orders for merchandise and products, including software, and such third parties may get access to your personal information for the purposes of providing services or products to you on our behalf. In addition, if you opt-out, we may share that information with third parties who send e-mails on our behalf so that they do not e-mail you.  However, we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on us; (2) protect and defend our rights or property; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety.  We may request demographic information from you (for example, your age, education level or household income) from time to time. We will not share that information in a manner that identifies you as an individual with any other entity, unless we let you know that at the time of collection or we have your permission. When we share demographic information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information only.  In the event that we acquired by another company, your personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party.  **Opt-Out** If you provide us with your e-mail address, and do not opt-out of receiving e-mail from us, we may e-mail you with information, including information about selected third parties. If you do not want to receive information from us, you may decline to receive it (or ""Opt-Out"") either when you provide personal information to us or you may update your profile. You may also choose to Opt-Out from certain types of e-mail by following the unsubscribe instructions that appear on each newsletter. You may also contact us as provided below. Please note that there might be a brief delay between when you submit your request to opt-out and when it is processed and reflected in our systems; accordingly you might continue to receive e-mails from us for a few days after you unsubscribe. We maintain records of those users who opt-out of specific e-mail options so that we do not e-mail them with respect to those types of e-mails, and we may share this information with third parties who send e-mails on our behalf so that they do not e-mail you; this information may also be contained in web logs (see above).  **Children Under 13** Our site is not directed to children under the age of 13. We assume products purchased through credit card means are purchased by adults. We respect the privacy of parents and children and are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). On those areas of the sites that ask for age, we do not collect personal information from individuals who identify themselves as under the age of 13 except in those limited circumstances where we believe that such collection is permitted under COPPA.  ****If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information to we, he or she can contact us via e-mail or postal mail as listed below. We will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13. Please note that it is possible some of this information may remain archived in web logs and back-up archives after we delete the information from its active database (see above regarding web logs, and below regarding archived information). We believe that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other personal information without parental permission.  **Other** We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. These include a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and maintenance of registration information in a separate database. Although we will exercise reasonable care in providing secure transmission of information between your computer and our servers, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet and we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure. We will protect the transmission of credit card information through industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.  We may offer chat, user reviews, multi-player games, bulletin board, or other public functions and any posting by you is considered public information available to other users. Any posting is governed by our Terms of Use. You should take care to not use personal information in your screen name or other information that might be publicly available to other users.

We maintain archives of our web logs, database, and other systems and information. Please note that it is possible some of this information may remain archived after we delete the information from its active database (see above regarding web logs). We maintain archives for disaster recovery, legal and other non-marketing purposes.  **Profile** You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of your profile by notifying us when you change your address, title, phone number, or e-mail address. If at any time you wish to update your information or stop receiving communication from us, sign in and then select ""update your profile"" to change your newsletter preferences.  **Contact** Please address comments or questions regarding this Privacy Policy to us by e-mail at [support@dumb.com](mailto:support@dumb.com).  **Binding Agreement** Your use of our site, including any dispute concerning privacy, is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.

"Welcome to the King.com website run by Midasplayer.com Limited (""we,"" ""us,"" and ""our""). We are committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of our King.com website (the ""Site"") (we refer to the Site and the services we provide as described in our Site collectively as the ""Site Features""). As such, we have established and implemented this privacy statement to inform visitors to the Site and users of the Site Features how we use and protect the information we collect. If you have any questions regarding this information or our privacy practices, please see the section entitled ""Questions? Contact Us"" at the end of this privacy statement. This privacy statement was last updated on June 24, 2009.  ### What information does King.com collect? We do not collect personally identifiable information unless our Members voluntarily provide it to us. We do, however, collect certain types of information and ask for personal information in certain circumstances, such as when you set up an account. The following sections describe what type of information we collect, when we collect it and how we use it.  ### Setting up an account In order to use certain functionality of the Site Features, you will have to create a user account which requires you to submit certain personal information. When you register and create an account, we require you to provide us with a user name of your choosing, your email address, your country of residence and a unique password. When you upgrade your account to Gold status, we require your name, billing address and credit, debit or charge card or PayPal account information. In addition, as a Gold member, you can include information you determine in your “player profile” and may upload photographs to your Player profile.  ### Cookies Cookies are small bits of electronic information that a web site can transfer to a visitor’s hard drive to help tailor and keep records of his or her visit to the site. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many web sites use them. Cookies allow web site operators to better customize visits to the site to the visitor’s individual preferences. For example, by setting a cookie you would not have to enter information in the Site more than once, thereby saving time. We do not receive or record any personal information in the cookies we use. We do use cookies to enable our system to recognize your computer, and to ensure that your account is attributed to the user who inputs the correct username and password for that account. We may also use cookies to serve advertising banners for our Game Service to you. These banners may be served by us or by a third party on our behalf. Again, these cookies will not contain any personal information.  Although most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser to prevent that or to notify you when you are sent a cookie. Even without accepting a cookie, you can still access the Site Features.  ### Use of Email Notifications We utilize e-mails to notify you when you win tournaments, alert you to withdrawals and to let you know of special promotions, events and policy changes. Important notices will be sent to your nominated email address as long as your account is open, but you have the choice to opt-in or opt-out of receiving any promotional e-mails at any time by sending an email to that effect, using the [dedicated form](https://web.archive.org/support/contact.jsp). We do not transfer or share your email address with any third parties.  ### How do we use the information you provide us? As stated above, we use your personal information such as your name, address, billing and mailing address and credit card number for billing purposes when we charge you for the use of your account. We also will use your email address to contact you as described above.  By registering as a Member, you agree that we may display the username you select, tournament scores and records. By accepting any prize, you further agree that in our promotional efforts we have the right to publish your username and tournament records in any media (newsletters, broadcasts, emails, etc.), without making any payment to you.  We reserve the right to collect general demographic and other anonymous information that does not personally identify you. This information is not associated with your personally identifiable information and cannot be linked to you personally. We may also provide aggregated information about our visitors to outside parties from time to time.  We may also disclose your personal information to one of our partners if you registered with us as a Member after clicking on a link on their website and you agreed that we could disclose such information to them.  In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of our assets, Members’ information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Members will be notified via prominent notice on the Site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of information of users held by us. If as a result of the business transition, information will be used for a purpose different from that stated, or implied, at the time of collection users will be given a choice consistent with our notification of changes section.  Notwithstanding any other term of this privacy statement, we may release any personal information we obtain or collect when we believe its release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our Site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property, or safety.  ## How does King.com protect Member information? We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the security of your personal information on our systems. User personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems. Any credit card information you supply us is transmitted and protected via Secure Socket Layer technology (""SSL"") and HTTPS protocol and then stored into our databases to be accessed only as stated above.  It is important to us that everyone playing our games plays fairly and we treat any abuse very seriously. We therefore take a number of measures intended to prevent abuse and ensure the smooth and uninterrupted performance of our games. You therefore agree that we can monitor your computer closely to detect any kind of attempt to cheat and that we can also make use of ""Active X"" controls and other methods to ensure that our Games are played fairly.  We will retain your personal data only as long as is necessary for the purposes to which you consent under this Member Agreement, and then we will delete it from our systems.  ## How do you opt in? When you initially establish your account, you will be asked if you would like to opt in to receiving email notifications and updates. You can change this preference at any time by accessing the ""My Account"" area of the Site.  ### Notification of changes. By visiting the Site or using the Site Features, you consent to the collection and use of information by us as set forth in this privacy statement. If we decide to change our privacy statement, we will post those changes within this page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  ### Questions?

When you share information with us, for example by creating a Google Account, we can make those services even better – to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy. ##Our Privacy Policy explains: ####What information we collect and why we collect it. ##How we use that information. ##The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.####We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Google so whether you are new to Google or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions consult this page. ##Information we collect##We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful or the people who matter most to you online. ##We collect information in two ways: ######Information you give us. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Google Account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Google Profile, which may include your name and photo. ######Information we get from your use of our services. We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes: ####Device information########We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Google may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Google Account. ##* **Log information**####When you use our services or view content provided by Google, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include: ##  * details of how you used our service, such as your search queries. ##  * telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls. ##  * [Internet protocol address](https://web.archive.org/web/20131231054930id_/http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-ip). ##  * device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL. ##  * cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Google Account.##* **Location information**####When you use a location-enabled Google service, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers. ##* **Unique application numbers**####Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Google when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates. ##* **Local storage**####We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches. ##* **Cookies and anonymous identifiers**####We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Google service, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or Google features that may appear on other sites.##How we use information we collect##We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Google and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads. ##We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google Account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Profile information, such as your name and photo. ##When you contact Google, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements. ##We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health. ##We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know. We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent. ##We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy. ##Google processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live. ##Transparency and choice##People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can: ####Review and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard. ##View and edit your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and across the web, such as which categories might interest you, using Ads Settings. You can also opt out of certain Google advertising services here. ##Use our editor to see and adjust how your Google Profile appears to particular individuals. ##Control who you share information with. ##Take information out of many of our services.####You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your language preferences. ##Information you share##Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines, including Google. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content. ##Accessing and updating your personal information##Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request. ##We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems). ##Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems. ##Information we share##We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Google unless one of the following circumstances applies: ####With your consent####We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google when we have your consent to do so. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. ####With domain administrators####If your Google Account is managed for you by a domain administrator (for example, for Google Apps users) then your domain administrator and resellers who provide user support to your organization will have access to your Google Account information (including your email and other data). Your domain administrator may be able to: ##* view statistics regarding your account, like statistics regarding applications you install. ##* change your account password. ##* suspend or terminate your account access. ##* access or retain information stored as part of your account. ##* receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request. ##* restrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy settings.####Please refer to your domain administrator’s privacy policy for more information. ####For external processing####We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. ####For legal reasons####We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: ##* meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request. ##* enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations. ##* detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. ##* protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.####We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. ##If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. ##Information security##We work hard to protect Google and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. In particular: ####We encrypt many of our services using SSL. ##We offer you two step verification when you access your Google Account, and a Safe Browsing feature in Google Chrome. ##We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems. ##We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.####Application##Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Google Inc. and its affiliates, including services offered on other sites (such as our advertising services), but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy. ##Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you in search results, sites that may include Google services, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads. ##Enforcement##We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self regulatory frameworks. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly. ##Changes##Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. ##Specific product practices##The following notices explain specific privacy practices with respect to certain Google products and services that you may use: ####Chrome and Chrome OS##Books##Wallet##Fiber##","We may collect information about the services you use and how you use them, like when you visit our advertising services or interact with our ads and content.

"# Privacy Policy | Cubics THE CUBICS SOCIAL NETWORK CHANNEL PRIVACY POLICY MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME.  PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES. This privacy policy (“Policy”) describes how information, including but not limited to personally identifiable information, you voluntarily provide, authorize to be released, or which is publicly available may be obtained and used for purposes of marketing by Adknowledge, Inc. and its Cubics social network advertising operations (together referred to herein as “Cubics”). Cubics is a technology company displaying advertisements through businesses which have contracted with Cubics to consumers who have voluntarily registered with Cubics or one of its partners, or through third party Websites, social networking applications and other means (together, these third party sources are referenced hereafter as “Publishers”). As used herein, “online” means using the Internet, including Websites and related technologies and “offline” means methods other than online, including in person, via postal mail, telephone and similar means. This Policy does not apply to the practices of Publishers or other companies that Cubics does not own or control or to people that Cubics does not employ or manage. Cubics retains its right to modify this policy from time to time by re-publishing it on the Internet; please check back for updates, as reflected in the “Effective as of” date above. Further, Cubics retains its right to enter into new or different lines of business with consumers and, if and to the extent it does so, may display a different Privacy Policy to the consumer for such lines of business. 1\. Collection of Information. 1.1 Subscription or Survey Information. Cubics collects information from you when you voluntarily provide it to Cubics or one of its Publishers (for example, by signing up for an email newsletter or through a co-registration offer on a survey), or by others means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a “User Form”). In a User Form, Cubics or a third party may offer you incentives in exchange for providing information about yourself such as name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers, birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, employment information, and personal and online interests (together, “User Information”). Completing the Surveys is voluntary and you are under no obligation to provide User Information. 1.2 Vendor List Information. Cubics may obtain information about you after you provide information to a third party and you permit that party (the “Seller”) to share the information, which Cubics subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise lawfully acquires. Such information may include, but is not limited to, your name, street address, zip code, telephone numbers, birth date, gender, salary range, education, marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and other information which you provided to the Seller (together, “Vendor List Information”). When acquiring Vendor List Information, Cubics requires assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Vendor List Information to Cubics and that Cubics may lawfully use the Vendor List Information to transmit offers from advertisers. 1.3 User Behaviors Collected with Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Technology and Information. Cubics uses cookie and web beacon technology to collect and associate certain Internet-related information about you, such as your Internet Protocol address and what Web browser you are using, with certain of your online behaviors, such as viewing or clicking on a particular online advertisement in order to provide you more relevant ads. Additionally, Cubics may use other new and evolving sources of information and information gathering in the future (together, “Technology Information”). (a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of your computer that allows Cubics to identify your Web browser with corresponding information in Cubics’ database. Cubics may use cookies to track individual responses or views of advertisements. You may read more about cookies at [www.cookiecentral.com](http://www.cookiecentral.com/). (b) Web beacons. A web beacon is programming code used to display an image on a web page or in an email and can also transfer an individual’s user identification, such as IP address and Web browser, to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about the individual. Web beacons enable Cubics to track certain Web sites you visit or advertisements you view online. Web beacons help determine products or services in which you may be interested and help track online behaviors for marketing purposes. More information about web beacons is available at <http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_beacon.html>. (c) Where Technology Information is Collected. Technology Information is collected directly from Cubics advertisements or indirectly through Publishers that Cubics contracts with to display advertisements. Such advertisements will usually be displayed within one of the following advertising vehicles: Websites. Cubics may set a cookie on your computer when you view advertisements delivered on Publisher Websites. After a cookie is set, Cubics may track how you interact with the advertisement and the Publisher Website (for example, registering, purchasing, browsing, etc.) through the use of Web beacons. Software Programs. Similar to Websites, Cubics displays banner advertisements in software programs and applications that you may use. Email Databases. Cubics may track your interaction with email advertisements sent to you on behalf of Publishers or partner Websites (for example, when you register, purchase, or browse in response to such email). 1.4 Outside Information. Cubics may lawfully receive information about you from third parties, such as information located in public databases (“Outside Information”). 1.5 No Information Collected from Minors. MINORS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 SHOULD NOT PROVIDE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING THEIR EMAIL ADDRESS, TO CUBICS. If Cubics is notified it has personal information about a minor under the age of 18, that information will be promptly deleted from our database. 1.6 Individual Information. As used herein, Individual Information means User Information, Vendor List Information, Technology Information, Outside Information, and any other information Cubics lawfully obtains about you. 2\. Use of Individual Information and User Data. 2.1 Discretion to Use Information. Information voluntarily provided to Cubics or lawfully obtained by Cubics is the property of Cubics and may be used by Cubics for any lawful purpose, including for marketing purposes. If you wish to end your email subscription with us or one of our Publishers, you may follow the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe or follow the instructions detailed at Section 4 below. 2.2 Targeted Advertising and Information. Cubics uses Individual Information to target advertising and other information, such as business, weather, entertainment, sports and general news alerts and similar information, more effectively. When an individual is online, Cubics uses Technology Information to associate an individual with their Individual Information and Cubics attempts to show information and advertising for products and services to which the person may respond. Cubics may use data collected from a response to one type of advertising or information for targeting advertisements or other information through a different venue. For example, Cubics may notice that you responded to a baseball banner advertisement and use that response to deliver a baseball-related advertisement and other information to you. 2.3 Legal Process. Cubics may disclose Individual Information to respond to subpoenas, court orders and other legal process as required by law. 2.4 Summary Data. Cubics may sell or transfer non-individualized information, such as summary or aggregated anonymous information about all persons or sub-groups of persons. 2.5 Storage of Individual Information. Cubics stores and maintains Individual Information in a database on Cubics computers. Some Individual Information may also be stored by Cubics’ Publishers on the Publishers’ computers. In addition, Cubics’ computers have security measures, such as a firewall, to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under Cubics’ control. Cubics also maintains physical and procedural safeguards to protect Individual Information. Notwithstanding such measures, Cubics cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent these computers from being illegally accessed and the Individual Information on them stolen or altered. 2.6 Business Transition. Cubics may transfer all or part of your Individual Information as part of a business transition such as a merger, acquisition, or asset sale. 3\.

Cubics may disclose or transfer Individual Information to wholly owned or controlled Cubics entities in Cubics’ discretion. 4\.

Cookies are ""txt"" files offered to your browser by a web server and then stored on the hard-disk of your computer. Most of browsers are set to accept cookies. But if you prefer, you can reset your browser so as to let you know whenever you receive a cookie or even to refuse cookies. However, you should know that some parts of Downloadastro website can only be normally seen if your browser allows cookies.  Downloadastro allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Downloadastro site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Downloadastro site.

Downloadastro does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Downloadastro to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Downloadastro Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.  You need to acknowledge that, whenever you disclose information in public areas on the website, such as message boards (comments) or forums, that information becomes public and can easily be tracked and used by unauthorized persons. Although Downloadastro.com does its best in order to protect your personal data, we cannot entirely grant you its safety. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. You should also know that you are the only one responsible for keeping the secret of your passwords, usernames etc.  **How and when we use the information**   Downloadastro uses the information collected from you for several purposes, depending on the type of data collected:   \- information provided directly by the user: this information is used only in order to personalize the services that we offer you and to check your identity;   \- information from traffic references: this type of info helps us identify the parts of our site of most interest for you.

"# Privacy Policy | DataScience+ Your privacy is critically important to us. At DataSciencePlus.com we have a few fundamental principles:  1. We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.  2. We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.  3. We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it. ### Information We Collect We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our services, and from outside sources.

For example, we collect information about the actions that users perform on a site–in other words, who did what, when and to what thing on a site (e.g., [WordPress username] created/edited/deleted “[title of post]” at [time/date]). We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views) along with information about your device (e.g., mobile screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.  **Location Information:** We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address.

"QRZ, is deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information. We welcome all users to our site and want to insure that you are comfortable. We pledge that as we gather and use information about you, we do so responsibly.     **Consumer Information**    QRZ.COM publishes information on the World Wide Web and on CDROM that is obtained from open, public domain sources and in some cases directly and voluntarily from users themselves. The information may include but is not limited to, your name, your address, your email address and possibly other data that you may voluntarily provide.     This information is generally used by members of the amateur radio community for the purposes of contacting each other through both internet and traditional means. Our site is also used as a means by which to share common interest information as it applies to the worldwide community of amateur radio operators.     Amateur radio address and contact information is and has been published in the public domain for a great many years. Before the advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web, the same types of information that we now provide was routinely published in printed directories (Callbooks). These directories are of a paramount interest to those involved in this particular hobby, especially as it applies to the exchange of written communications that result from contacts made on the air.     **Data Collection and Opt Out**    Participation in the QRZ data collection process is voluntary except for the occasional use of browser ""cookies"".     QRZ, as well as most sites on the Internet, occasionaly may use ""cookies"" to enhance your experience on the web. QRZ does not and cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way.     **What are cookies and why do we use them?**  Our cookies consist of a unique random number that our system generates and hands back to your browser. As you move from page to page within the QRZ site, we are able to verify your login identity without asking you to re-submit your password each time. This is done so that only you may update your callsign information, your biography or your photo, and, so that only you may post new messages in your name.     The cookie that QRZ assigns does not contain any personal information whatsoever.     Cookies are only required by QRZ if you intend to update information relating to callsigns, or, if you intend to post articles or want ads on our site. To participate as a reader and/or observer only, cookies are not required.     **Opt Out Procedure**    If you would like to ""opt out,"" that is, to prevent any non-FCC data from being displayed by QRZ about you, please notify us by email. Please contact us at [The QRZ Support Center](https://forums.qrz.com/support) and simply state your amateur radio CALLSIGN and that you would like your information removed from QRZ.     Please be aware that with the exception of your street address that information that is published by the FCC in the public domain will continue to be displayed by QRZ even after you opt out. 'Opting Out' affects only that data that the FCC does **not** provide. Non-FCC data includes your birth date, your biography, your picture, your email address, and your home page address.     Note that street address de-listing by QRZ will not change the FCC's records in any way. Your information will still be available to anyone who wants it at the FCC's official website.

From time to time, 7Theme may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. 7Theme also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on 7theme.net blogs/sites. 7Theme only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left. ### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information Certain visitors to 7Theme’s websites choose to interact with 7Theme in ways that require 7Theme to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that 7Theme gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at [7theme.net](http://7theme.net/) to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with 7Theme are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, 7Theme collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with 7Theme. 7Theme does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. ### Aggregated Statistics 7Theme may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. 7Theme may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, 7Theme does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. ### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information 7Theme discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on 7Theme’s behalf or to provide services available at 7Theme’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using 7Theme’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. 7Theme will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, 7Theme discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when 7Theme believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of 7Theme, third parties or the public at large.

If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. 7Theme takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. ### Cookies A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. 7Theme uses cookies to help 7Theme identify and track visitors, their usage of 7Theme website, and their website access preferences. 7Theme visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using 7Theme’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of 7Theme’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies. ### Business Transfers If 7Theme, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that 7Theme goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of 7Theme may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy. ### Ads Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.

About Socialbakers##Socialbakers is a provider of Software as a Service (SaaS) AI-Powered solution for social media marketing. For more information about Socialbakers, please see the “Company” section of our site at https://www.socialbakers.com/company/. ##2. Data we collect or receive##We collect personal data from our customers and users of the Services (which includes employees of our corporate or institutional customers) for our own purposes, such as to provide and administer the Services. We are the data controller in respect of this personal data. ##In order to provide our Services, we analyse user profiles and other information that we receive directly from the social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other, via these platforms’ APIs. Such data include both non-personal data such as various statistics and metrics and personal data of the platforms’ users. Where we source the data directly from the relevant platforms, via these platforms’ public APIs, we determine the purpose of processing, which is developing and constantly enhancing our Services and offering them to our customers on a world-wide basis, via our web platform. In such cases, we are the data controller with respect to such data. ##We also process personal data on behalf of our customers as a data processor; this is when the provision of certain Service or specific feature requires that our customers give us a permission (such as, for example, an access token or other administrative permission), within the Service, to access and manage any information that our customers monitor or collect from social media sites; this may include information that is not publicly available. When we access customer’s data with respect to which the customers are the data controllers, we act in accordance with the instructions of our customers (which they give us through the Services) as their data processor. This will be, for example, when we access Facebook Insights or facilitate and organize the communication (e.g. Facebook messages) between the customer and its end users within our customer care feature of the Community Service. ##2.1 Data of customers and users of our Services##We collect your personal data when:####You register or use registration for our Services, by completing a web registration form; ##You log to our Service, either by entering your username (email) and password, or using a social login such as Connect with Facebook or Sign In with Twitter, or by any other similar authentication means that we may make available to you; ##You use our Services or otherwise interact with Socialbakers, for example when you publish any images, content or other files or data via our Services; ##You otherwise voluntarily provide such data, e.g. by filling out and submitting any forms made available to you through Socialbakers’ website or the Services or through websites or services of our business partners. ####When you create an account with Socialbakers, we will ask you to complete a registration form indicating your first name, surname, email, company, and job title.

The scope of details we receive depends on your social network account privacy settings and on your settings when logging into our Services; they might include your social network ID, public profile information (such as name, profile picture, gender, age range, or country) and e-mail address. We may also receive additional information from your profile if you give us permission to access it.

"The Internet, Privacy and Nightingale-Conant The Internet contains a wealth of information. Unfortunately, it may also contain personal details about you that you don't want everyone to know. For example, your real name (lots of people on the Internet use aliases, alter egos or nicknames), street address, phone number, or e-mail address. Also, when you go online, sites you visit may be gathering information about you without your knowledge. Upon your first visit to Nightingale-Conant, Nightingale-Conant sends a ""cookie"" to your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It stores personal preferences and user data. In no way does this tell us that you're ""Bob Smith.""  Nightingale-Conant has two primary uses for its cookies. First, we use them to specify unique preferences. For example, when ordering products and services through our Web site, after your initial registration, your preferences pertaining to shipping and billing locations are remembered by our system. This way you don't have to tell us over and over again where you want your products sent. Secondly, we use cookies to track user trends and patterns. This helps us better understand and improve areas of the Nightingale-Conant Web site that our users find valuable. While both of these activities depend on the use of a ""cookie,"" visitors to Nightingale-Conant always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. Most browses are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of the Nightingale-Conant Web site may not function properly if you refuse cookies.

Nightingale-Conant will never willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer's permission. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Using the Internet should be a fun experience and we want to help you make it so. Nightingale-Conant shares information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. However, in most cases, we talk about our users in aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we will say Nightingale-Conant's audience is x percent females and y percent males. This data is used to customize Nightingale-Conant content and advertising for our users. There are cases where Nightingale-Conant may ask you for personal information such as your name or address. We do this when you register to our site or make a product or service purchase. When we intend to use your personal information, we tell you up front. This way you can decide whether you want to give us the information or not. For example, we may want to send you product or service announcements via e-mail or regular mail at your request. In case you change your mind or some personal information may change (such as your billing or shipping address), you may easily correct, update or remove the personal data you give us by using our Account Status Area.","A ""cookie"" is a file that identifies you as a unique user.

"Thanks for entrusting gitconnected with your projects, your posts, and your personal information. Holding onto your private information is a serious responsibility, and we want you to know how we're handling it. ### What information gitconnected collects and Why In order to give you the best possible experience using gitconnected, we collect information from your interactions with our network. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs. We collect this basic information from everybody, whether they have an account or not. The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes:   * The visitor’s browser type   * Referring site   * The date and time of each visitor request   * We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We use this information to:   * Provide, test, improve, promote and personalize gitconnected Services   * Fight spam and other forms of abuse   * Generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how people use gitconnected Services In order for you to create an account on gitconnected and use our Services, we need to collect and process certain information. Depending on your use of the Services, that may include:   * Communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem);   * Information that you submit on or to gitconnected in the form of reactions, comments, or messages to other users;   * The email address associated with your GitHub account, if you choose to sign up using your GitHub credentials. gitconnected will also request permission to access additional information (these permissions are governed by GitHub’s privacy policies and can be managed through your GitHub privacy settings). We never post anything to your GitHub without your permission.   * You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include “User Personal Information.” ### Information Disclosure We do not share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for commercial purposes. We do share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use gitconnected. For example, we may share information pertaining to the popularity of different programming languages for advertising partners. We do host first-party advertising on gitconnected. We do not run any code from advertisers and all ad images are hosted on managed gitconnected servers. For more details, see our section on Advertising Details. We may use User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have authorized. For example, if you indicate you are looking for work, we may contact you with opportunities. We will only use or share information where we believe it will benefit you. For example, opportunities for education, career growth, or mentorship. We may share User Personal Information with a limited number of third party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own Privacy Statement. Our third party vendors are listed below. ### Advertising Details We target advertisements based solely upon:   * Details of the page where the advertisement is shown, including:   * The name and keywords associated with the page or article being viewed   * We allow advertisers to target ads to a list of keywords advertising.   * If you indicate an interest in certain programming languages or technologies, we may display ads that will provide content more relevant to your interests with the goal of providing a better experience We may place ads in:   * Sidebars   * Below articles   * On search result pages   * On tag pages   * Our dedicated Sponsors page ### Third Party Vendors  **We may share your account information with third parties in some circumstances, including:** (1) with your consent; (2) to a service provider or partner who meets our data protection standards; (3) for survey or research purposes, after aggregation, anonymization, or pseudonomization; (4) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process; (5) when we have a good faith belief that doing so will help prevent imminent harm to someone.  **Data Storage** gitconnected uses third-party vendors and hosting partners for hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology we need to run gitconnected. By using gitconnected Services, you authorize gitconnected to transfer, store, and use your information in the United States and any other country where we operate. All service providers and third-party vendors are required to meet our data protection standards.  **Site monitoring** gitconnected uses a variety of third-party services to diagnose errors and improve the performance of our site. We aim to minimize the amount of personal information shared, but the information may include your IP address or other identifying information. All service providers and third-party vendors are required to meet our data protection standards.  **Payment processing** gitconnected does not process payments directly — we rely on third-party services such as Stripe, Shopify, and Paypal to receive payments and store any payment information. [The gitconnected Shop](https://shop.gitconnected.com/) is run through Shopify, a third-party e-commerce platform with their own Privacy Policy.  **Third-Party Embeds** Some of the content that you see displayed on gitconnected is not hosted by gitconnected. These “embeds” are hosted by a third-party and embedded in gitconnected. For example: YouTube videos, Codepens, Twitter tweets, or GitHub code that appear within a gitconnected post. These files send data to the hosted site just as if you were visiting that site directly (for example, when you load a gitconnected post page with a YouTube video embedded in it, YouTube receives data about your activity). gitconnected does not control what data third parties collect in cases like this, or what they will do with it. Third-party embeds on gitconnected are not covered by this privacy policy; they are covered by the privacy policy of the third-party service. Be mindful when interacting with these services.  **Facebook (visitor action pixel)** We use the “visitor action pixels” from Facebook Inc on our website. This allows user behavior to be tracked after they have been redirected to our website by clicking on a Facebook ad. This enables us to measure the effectiveness of Facebook ads. The data collected in this way is anonymous to us, i.e. we do not see the personal data of individual users. However, this data is stored and processed by Facebook, which is why we are informing you, based on our knowledge of the situation. Facebook may link this information to your Facebook account and also use it for its own promotional purposes, in accordance with [Facebook’s Data Usage Policy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/). You can object to the collection of your data by Facebook pixel, or to the use of your data for the purpose of displaying Facebook ads by contacting the following address: <https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads>.  **Tracking & Cookies** We use browser cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you return to our Services. Third-party vendors may also use cookies for various reasons. gitconnected uses a specific cookie in order to facilitate the use of Google Universal Analytics for users logged-in to the Applications or the Platforms (“Logged-In User). If you are a Logged-In User, gitconnected may use your gitconnected user ID in combination with Google Universal Analytics and Google Analytics to track and analyze the pages of the Services you visit.

Google Analytics cookies do not provide gitconnected with any Personal Information. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser. You may opt-out of this feature by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, by setting your web browser to refuse cookies, or by setting your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent.

We do this only to better understand how you use the Website and the other Services, with a view to offering improvements for all gitconnected users; and to tailor our business and marketing activities accordingly, both generally and specifically to you. You can also use tools to prevent Amplitude from recognzing you on return visits.  **Data Security** We use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data transmitted to and from our site. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, so we can’t guarantee security. You use the Service at your own risk, and you’re responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account.  **Administrative Emails from gitconnected** Sometimes we’ll send you emails about your account, service changes or new policies. You can’t opt out of this type of “transactional” email (unless you delete your account). When you interact with a transactional email sent from gitconnected (such as opening an email or clicking on a particular link in an email), we may receive information about that interaction.  **Non-administrative Emails from gitconnected** Upon creating a gitconnected account, you will be opted into the gitconnected Newsletter and other non-administrative email. Your email address and user profile information may be stored by a third-party email provider such as MailChimp or Sendgrid. You can opt out of non-administrative emails such as digests, newsletters, and activity notifications through your account’s “Settings” page and at the link of the footer in any non-administrative email you receive from us. When you interact with a non-administrative email sent from gitconnected (such as opening an email or clicking on a particular link in an email), we may receive information about that interaction.  **Deleting Your Personal Information** You may request deletion of your personal information and account by emailing privacy@gitconnected.com. To protect information from accidental or malicious destruction, we may maintain residual copies for a brief time period. But, if you delete your account, your information and content will be unrecoverable after that time.  **Data Portability** If you would like to request a copy of your user data, please email privacy@gitconnected.com.  **Business Transfers** If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization or sale of assets such that your information would be transferred or become subject to a different privacy policy, we’ll notify you in advance of any such change.  **Changes to this Policy** We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time.

Email [securityofficer@cfa.org](mailto:securityofficer@cfa.org)    ### **About this Privacy Policy**   This Privacy Policy has been published to provide a clear and concise outline of how and when personal information is collected, disclosed, used, stored and otherwise handled by The Cat Fanciers' Association, Inc (CFA). The Policy relates to personal information collected by any means and by any technology.    CFA treats the handling of your personal information very seriously. To that end, CFA has systems and procedures in place to protect your privacy in relation to the handling of your personal information.    CFA's objective is to handle information responsibly and provide you with some control over the way information about you is handled.  **  1\. Collection of Personal Information **   Personal information is information or opinion from which an individual's identity may be ascertained. The nature of personal information collected by CFA through our web site generally comprises an individual's name and contact details (including address, phone, fax and e-mail). Such personal information is not maintained in our files, unless required for specific contest entry purposes, survey purposes, etc..    CFA collects information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information, contest entry information and/or site registrations, name and address, telephone number, fax number, payment information (e.g., credit card number and billing address).    CFA also collects other types of personal information from time to time (eg. credit information), only for purposes of online catalog sales, registration fees, etc.    CFA does not collect personal information unless it is necessary for CFA to perform one or more of its functions and activities. CFA will destroy personal information when it is no longer required for such functions and activities.    CFA will generally collect personal information from you directly. For example, CFA may collect personal information via telephone or letter, when you attend a function or event, request printed information or specific mailings, enter a competition, or provide a resume.  **  2\. Use & Disclosure of Personal Information **   Personal information provided to CFA may be shared with related committees within CFA, where it will be kept strictly confidential and will only be disclosed on a need-to-know basis. CFA will only use and disclose your personal information for the purpose for which the personal information was initially collected.    CFA may also use that personal information for a purpose related to the initial purpose of collection if that other purpose would be within your reasonable expectations. Related purposes might include adding your name to a contact list, email notification or invitation list.    CFA will not use or disclose your personal information for any other purposes without first obtaining your express or implied consent. CFA may however be required to disclose your personal information without your consent if the disclosure is:  a. required or authorized by law;  b. required in order to investigate an unlawful activity;  c. required by an enforcement body for investigative activities; or  d. necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to a person's life, health or safety, or to public health or safety.  **  3\. Direct Marketing **   From time to time CFA may use your personal information to identify activities which may be of interest to you to send you information regarding products available through CFA's business partners.    If you do not wish to receive direct marketing information, please let CFA know. CFA will take immediate steps to ensure that you do not receive any direct marketing information in future.  **  4\. Ad Servers **   CFA does not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies.  **  5\. Cookies**   CFA uses cookies to store visitor preferences, record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart, secure area login data, etc.  **  6\. Personal Information Security**   CFA is committed to keeping your personal information secure, and we will take all reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse or alteration.    Your personal information may be stored in hard copy documents, or electronically on CFA's software or systems.    CFA maintains physical security over its paper and electronic data stores, such as locks and security systems. CFA also maintains computer and network security using passwords to control and restrict access to authorized staff for approved purposes.  **  7\. Access To Personal Information **   You may request access to the personal information CFA holds about you.    The procedure for gaining access is as follows:  a. All requests for access to your personal information must be made in writing and addressed to the Executive Director.  b. You must provide as much detail as possible regarding the business entity, department or person to whom you believe your personal information has been provided, and when. This will allow CFA to process your request faster.  c. CFA will acknowledge your request within 14 days, and access will usually be granted within 14 days, or if it is more complicated, 30 days. CFA will inform you if this timeframe is not achievable.  d. You will be asked to verify your identity.  e. A fee may apply to such access in the event that a request for access is onerous or time consuming. Such a fee will cover staff costs involved in locating and collating information, and reproduction costs.  f. Depending on the circumstances, you may be forwarded the information by mail or email, or you may be required to personally inspect your records at the appropriate place.  g. You will be given the opportunity to correct any personal information which is no longer accurate.    In some circumstances, CFA may not be in a position to provide access. Such circumstances include where:  a. providing access will have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other individuals;  b. denying access is required or authorized by law;  c. the request is frivolous;  d. legal proceedings are underway;  e. negotiations may be prejudiced by such access; or  f. access would reveal a commercially sensitive decision making process.    If CFA denies access to your personal information, it will provide you with reasons in writing.  **  8\. Changes To This Policy **   CFA may change this Policy from time to time for any reason and will update the Policy accordingly.  **  9\. Complaints**   If you believe that your privacy has been infringed you are entitled to complain. All complaints should initially be in writing and directed to the Executive Director. CFA will respond to your complaint as soon as possible, within 14 working days, to let you know who is responsible for managing your query. CFA will try to resolve the complaint within 30 working days. When this is not possible CFA will contact you to provide an estimate of how long it will take to handle the complaint.

In addition to information provided directly by you, we (and third parties that offer features through the Site) may collect non-PII through the use of “cookies,” “web beacons,” “Flash cookies” or by other electronic means. **Cookies.** In general, a cookie is a small amount of data sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive, where it can be used to identify your computer. Cookies can be used to measure web site usage, improve navigation around web sites, and personalize a returning visitor’s experience on the website. In most cases, you can set your browser to turn off cookies or to notify you before you receive one so that you can decide whether to accept it or not.

In addition, we may share your information as described below: **Information You Elect to Share.** You may choose to share information with Third Parties by clicking on links to those Third Parties from within the Site. In addition, you may elect to share information, including PII, through the Services offered on the Site by, for instance, posting comments on comment boards or listing classified advertisements. Some of your activity on the Site, including content you have posted, is public by default. Some of this content may include PII. **Third-Party Advertisers and Web Sites.** We may share your non-PII with, or make your non-PII available to, Third Parties as described in the section above titled Third-Party Advertising and Third-Party Web Sites. **Information Disclosed to Vendors, Partners, Service Providers, and Others for Business Purposes.** We contract with vendors to provide services related to the Site and may share information with such vendors in order to provide products or services to you or to help maintain the Site. We also may share non-PII with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. **Information Disclosed for the Protection of the Site and for Others.** We may disclose PII (1) when required by law or to respond to legal process or lawful requests, including from law enforcement; (2) when we believe it is necessary to prevent, investigate, or address (a) possible illegal activities, including fraud, (b) a violation of our Terms of Use, (c) a violation of this Policy, or (d) a threat to the physical safety of any person; or (3) to protect our rights or property. **Information Security.** We take information security seriously, and we use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the PII we collect from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. However, no system can be completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that we will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose your PII. **California Privacy Rights.** Under California law, California residents may request once a year, free of charge, certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes. Specifically, we will provide a list of the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for third-party direct marketing purposes, along with the names and addresses of these third parties. To make such a request, please email us at [legal@ksl.com](mailto:legal@ksl.com) or write to us at: Legal Department, Bonneville International Corporation, 55 North 300 West, Salt Lake City, Utah 84145. We reserve our right not to respond to requests submitted other than to the email or postal address specified above. You should put “California Privacy Rights” in the subject line and in your request. You must provide us with the specific information regarding yourself so that we can accurately respond to your request. **California Do Not Track Disclosure.** Certain web browsers may allow you to enable a “do not track” option that sends signals to the websites you visit indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different than blocking cookies as browsers with the “do not track” option selected may still accept cookies. Right now, there is no industry standard for how companies should respond to “do not track” signals, although one may be adopted in the future. Operator does not respond to “do not track” signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will modify this Policy accordingly. More information about “do not track” is available at [www.allaboutdnt.org](http://www.allaboutdnt.org/).

We have enabled Google Analytics advertising features such as remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit our website, not your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected using Google Analytics with Personal Data. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our website, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google also uses specific identifiers to help collect information about the use of our website. For more information on how Google collects and processes your data, [visit this link](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/) [You can prevent Google Analytics from using your information by opting out at this link](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) #### Embedded content from other websites Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.).

The operator of the pages is YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. If you visit one of our pages featuring a YouTube plugin, a connection to the YouTube servers is established. Here the YouTube server is informed about which of our pages you have visited. If you’re logged in to your YouTube account, YouTube allows you to associate your browsing behavior directly with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account. YouTube is used to help make our website appealing. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Further information about handling user data, can be found in the data protection declaration of YouTube under  [google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy](https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy). #### Google Web Fonts For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly. When you call up a page of our website that contains a social plugin, your browser makes a direct connection with Google servers. Google thus becomes aware that our web page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is done in the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our website. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by your computer. Further information about handling user data,  can be found at  [developers.google.com/fonts/faq](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq)  and in Google’s privacy policy at  [google.com/policies/privacy/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). #### Google reCAPTCHA We use “Google reCAPTCHA” (hereinafter “reCAPTCHA”) on our websites. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). reCAPTCHA is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. For the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to Google. The reCAPTCHA analyses take place completely in the background. Website visitors are not advised that such an analysis is taking place. Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam. More information about [Google reCAPTCHA and Google’s privacy policy](https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/) #### Google Maps This site uses the Google Maps map service via an API. It is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. To use Google Maps, it is necessary to save your IP address.

The use of Google Maps is in the interest of making our website appealing and to facilitate the location of places specified by us on the website. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

"# RACGP - Privacy statement ## 1\. Your personal information is important to us Providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that seriously. We are committed to protecting your personal information. ## 2\. Privacy statement This Privacy statement sets out the RACGP's policy concerning the collection holding, use and disclosure of your personal information. It provides you with information and options on how to access and correct your personal information. This Privacy statement sets out how we manage personal information to meet our obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act). We believe our Privacy Statement not only complies with relevant laws but also represents best practice. In the unlikely instance this Statement conflicts with the Privacy Act, the Privacy Act prevails. ## 3\. Definitions Personal information means information or opinions about a person from which that person is reasonably identifiable. Personal information includes sensitive information. Sensitive information includes information about a person's beliefs, finances, associations or health. Health information means information or opinions about a person’s health. It includes information collected in connection with the delivery of health services. ## 4\. Collecting your personal information The RACGP may collect personal information as reasonably necessary for one or more of its functions. We will only collect personal information by lawful and fair means and primarily directly from you (for example, through our interaction with you or your use of our website). As a non-profit organisation, we may collect members’ information for activities that further our charitable purposes, where the information relates to that purpose. However, wherever practicable we will de-identify personal information. In certain circumstances you may not need to identify yourself, or may use of a pseudonym instead. We will ordinarily alert you to these circumstances when available. The type of personal information collected may depend on your interaction with us. For example, if you are an RACGP member, we may collect:  * your name  * your contact information (postal address, email address, telephone etc), including your preferred manner of contact for personal and professional purposes  * professional practice information, including qualifications, addresses and areas of professional interest, and  * information relating to your membership or Fellowship, assessments and continuing professional development requirements (as appropriate). If we receive unsolicited personal information, or information we would not ordinarily be permitted to collect, we will ordinarily destroy or de-identify that information. We will take reasonable steps to notify you of our collection of your personal information. Any such notification will include all additional information required by the Privacy Act. ### Collection through RFID technology At certain events, the RACGP may use radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. RFID technology generally consists of a transponder which transmits data and a reader which collects that data. RFID technology assembles this data to provide information on user travel within an event. RFID technology is now commonly used across a variety of industries. The RACGP considers RFID technology will assist with determining foot traffic or events of interest during conferences (for example). The RACGP will use reasonable efforts to notify you where RFID technology is used and provide an opt-out function. RFID technology where identifiable will constitute personal information. It will be stored within your conference profile and may be exported to your member record. It will be treated in confidence as for all other member information. ## 5\. Use of your personal information Personal information is kept until we are no longer legally obliged to keep, or when the need for the personal information has passed (at which point it will be destroyed, deleted or de-identified). Our purpose for collecting your personal information will to a degree depend on your interaction with us. For members, our primary purpose for collection is to administer and provide you with the full benefits of and administering your membership, providing services, sending related information, or as a record of confirmation of attainment of academic qualifications, or QI&CPD status. For QI&CPD participants, our primary purpose is similar, though focussed on administering and maintaining your QI&CPD status. For other individuals, personal information may be collected to respond to enquiries or comply with other legal obligations. We may also require limited disclosure to contractors we engage to act for us or on our behalf, such as IT service providers, in order to enable them to provide their services. All contractors engaged in this fashion are required to comply with the privacy laws. Other than for administration or membership purposes,or to confirm whether you have achieved Fellowship with the RACGP, we will not use or disclose your personal information without your consent. Some permitted exceptions to this apply, including where we are legally required to disclose, or to protect the personal safety of any individual or the public. We will periodically disclose subsets of your information to APHRA, Medicare and regional training organisations (if relevant) for regulatory purposes. The RACGP may periodically share your personal information with RACGP Oxygen Pty Ltd. Any such personal information will continue to be used for the purpose of its collection unless an exception applies. We will not ordinarily disclose your personal information to anyone outside of Australia. However, we do share limited subsets of member’s personal information, to our engaged external contact centres to provide related business, marketing and support services. These providers are currently based in the United States of America. Any information disclosed is used strictly only for the intended purposes. We periodically review our engagement of such providers to ensure privacy compliance. ## 6\.

Your information is either stored on secure servers (electronic records) or is protected in controlled facilities (hard copy records).

"####Welcome to itsmyurls.com - Privacy page##|##| ##| Privacy##Itsmyurls, Inc. (“Itsmyurls” or “we”) operates Itsmyurls.com. This Privacy Policy describes Itsmyurls’s use and sharing of personally identifiable information (“PII”-- your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, or credit card number) that Members voluntarily provide to Itsmyurls when they register (also known as “Registration PII”). The Term “User” refers to a Visitor or a Member. This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by Itsmyurls, including any Itsmyurls-branded URL (the “Itsmyurls Website”), and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by Itsmyurls in connection with the Itsmyurls Website (collectively, the “Itsmyurls Services”). The Itsmyurls Services are hosted in the United States. The Itsmyurls Website is a general audience site and does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age. From time to time Itsmyurls may modify this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of the Itsmyurls Services, or technology, and such modifications shall be effective upon posting by Itsmyurls on the Itsmyurls Website.##Your continued use of the Itsmyurls Services after Itsmyurls posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. If Itsmyurls materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change. COLLECTION AND SUBMISSION OF PII AND NON-PII ON ITSMYURLS General. When Itsmyurls collects PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting Registration PII to us in order to register as a Member of Itsmyurls. Itsmyurls may also collect PII from you if you choose to participate in Itsmyurls Services activities like sweepstakes, contests, and surveys, because you want us to furnish you with products, services, newsletters, or information, or in connection with content or suggestions you submit to Itsmyurls for review. In addition, Itsmyurls collects other non-PII including IP address, aggregate user data, and browser type. ##This data is used to manage and improve the Itsmyurls Services, track usage, and for security purposes. Itsmyurls Members may also choose to provide or store non-PII information in their profiles, including but not limited to date of birth, interests, hobbies, lifestyle choices, groups with whom they are affiliated (schools, companies). The Profile Information in a Member’s profile is provided at his or her sole discretion. Cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that Itsmyurls places on your computer. Itsmyurls uses cookies to identify your Internet browser, store Users’ preferences, and determine whether you have installed the enabling software needed to access certain material on the Itsmyurls Services. ##Data in cookies may be read to authenticate user sessions or provide services. Third party advertisements displayed on Itsmyurls Services may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers (known as “third party cookies”). Itsmyurls does not control these third party cookies and Users of the Itsmyurls Services should check the privacy policy of the Internet advertising company or advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. See the “Notice” section below for more information on customized advertising on Itsmyurls. A pixel tag is a tiny image inserted in a webpage and used to record the number and types of views for that page. Itsmyurls may allow third party pixel tags to be present on Itsmyurls Services for purposes of advertising, providing services or data and statistics collection. You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent, block third party cookies or block all cookies. However, by blocking all cookies you may not have access to certain features on the Itsmyurls Services. ##NOTICE: ITSMYURLS WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES When you voluntarily provide PII to Itsmyurls, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses Itsmyurls will make of the information to the extent it is being used in a manner that differs from what is allowed pursuant to this Privacy Policy. At the time you provide your PII, Itsmyurls will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII (See “Choice” below). Except as described in this Privacy Policy, Itsmyurls will not share your PII with third parties unless you have given Itsmyurls permission to do so (See “Use” below). Itsmyurls Services may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Itsmyurls Services may also carry advertisements from other companies.##Itsmyurls is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites or other services operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with the Itsmyurls Services or for the privacy practices of third party Internet advertising companies. Once you leave Itsmyurls Services via such a link, access a third party application (such as widgets) or click on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine, among other things, how they will handle any PII they collect from you. ##Itsmyurls may use cookies and similar tools to customize the content and advertising you receive based on the Profile Information you have provided. Profile Information you provide in structured profile fields or questions (multiple choice questions like “Marital Status,” “Education” and “Children”) (“Structured Profile Information”), information you add to open-ended profile fields and questions (essay questions like “About Me,” “Interests” and “Movies”) (“Non-Structured Profile Information”) and other non-PII about you may also be used to customize the online ads you encounter to those we believe are aligned with your interests. For example, based on your music interests we might display an advertisement to make sure you are advised when your favorite band is coming to town. The information used for this feature does not provide your PII or identify you as an individual to third parties.##Some of the advertisements that appear on Itsmyurls Services may also be delivered to you by third party Internet advertising companies. These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect non-PII about your visit to or use of Itsmyurls Services, including information about the ads they display, via a cookie placed on your computer that reads your IP address.##USE: ITSMYURLS'S USE OF PII##Itsmyurls will only use the PII you provide under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If Itsmyurls obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is also governed by this Privacy Policy.##In order to locate other Itsmyurls Members that you may already know in the physical world, Itsmyurls allows Users to search for Members using Registration PII (i.e., full name or email address). ##If you have consented to receive promotional materials (e.g., newsletters) or notifications from Itsmyurls, Itsmyurls may periodically use your email address to send you such materials related to the Itsmyurls Services, as applicable. If you want to stop receiving such materials from Itsmyurls, follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email. ##Itsmyurls employees, agents and contractors must have a business reason to obtain access to your PII. Itsmyurls may share your PII with those who help us manage or provide Itsmyurls Services’ information activities (for example, message board administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses, data processing), or with outside contractors, agents or sponsors who help us with the administration, judging and prize fulfillment aspects of contests, promotions and sweepstakes.##These outside contractors, agents or sponsors may temporarily store some information on their servers, but they may only use your PII to provide Itsmyurls with a specific service and not for any other purpose. Itsmyurls may also provide your PII to a third party in those instances where you have chosen to receive certain information and have been notified that the fulfillment of such a request requires the sharing of your PII. Itsmyurls also may share your PII with Affiliated Companies if it has a business reason to do so.##As described in “Notice” above, Itsmyurls may customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on the Itsmyurls Website, or may work with outside companies to do so. Your non-PII and/or Profile Information may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. Itsmyurls prohibits these companies from sharing your non-PII and/or Profile Information with any third party or from using it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream, number of page views calculated by pixel tags, and aggregated demographic information may also be shared with Itsmyurls’s advertisers and business partners.##There may be instances when Itsmyurls may access or disclose PII, Profile Information or non-PII without providing you a choice in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of Itsmyurls, our Affiliated Companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of Users of the Itsmyurls Services or members of the public including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if Itsmyurls sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of all or a material part of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, Itsmyurls may transfer your PII to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.##When a Member who is located in the European Union chooses to post Profile Information that will be publicly disclosed, that Member is responsible for ensuring that such information conforms to all local data protection laws. Itsmyurls is not responsible under the EU local data protection laws for Member-posted information.##SECURITY: ITSMYURLS PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII##Itsmyurls uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII and credit card information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, Itsmyurls uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete.####ACCESS, REMEDIES AND COMPLIANCE: HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR CHANGE YOUR PREFERENCES REGARDING YOUR PII AND HOW TO CONTACT ITSMYURLS ABOUT PRIVACY CONCERNS##Whenever possible, Itsmyurls Members may review the Registration PII we maintain about them in our records. We will take reasonable steps to correct any PII a Member informs us is incorrect. ##If you would like to communicate with us about this Privacy Policy or Itsmyurls’s collection and use of your PII please contact Itsmyurls at .itsmyurls@gmail.com.","This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by ItsMyURLs, including any ItsMyUrls-branded URL (the ""ItsMyURLS Website"") and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by Itsmyurls in connection with the ItsMyurls Website (collectively, the “ItsMyurlS Services”).

"**Tobii AB (publ) is committed to** ensuring that your privacy is protected. Should we ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified when using our websites, our services or our products (below we use the word ""Services"" for easier review), you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy outlines how Tobii generally handles your personal data. In connection with some of our Services, we will give you more specific information about our handling of your personal data, and we will, where appropriate, ask for your consent before handling your personal data. At the end of this policy, there is information on how to contact us if you have any questions or if you think anything is unclear.  ## 1\. What we collect Depending on which Services you use, we must process different kinds of information from or about you. Here's how: **Personal data and other information you (and others) give us.**  We collect the information that you (and others) give us when using our Services. For example:  * When you register to use our Services, we may ask for information such as your name, email address and phone number.  * For many of our Services, you will have the opportunity to create a user profile (for example in one of our web-based Services), and add information to your profile after registration.  * If you buy something from us, we collect information about the transaction. This can include your payment information, purchase activity and delivery and contact details.  * When you communicate with Tobii, you provide us with information such as your email address.   * Depending on which Services you use, you have the option of submitting information about your physical features, such as information about your eyes and disabilities concerning your eyes, or other health related data.  * If you seek customer support for one of our Services, then it's sometimes necessary for us to access your personal information to be able to help you with your problem (for example if we need to remotely control your device to troubleshoot). In those cases, we will either delete the data once the support matter has been resolved (as in the remote control case), or store the data according to applicable retention routines within the Tobii group, if we find that either you or Tobii has a legitimate interest in doing so.  * We collect content and information about content that you create using our Services. **Personal data and other information which is automatically collected about you when you use our services.**  We also collect information automatically when you are connected to our Services. Depending on how you access and use our Services, we collect information such as:  * Information about how you access our Services, including information about the type of device that you're using, its configuration (such as your operating system and graphics processing unit), your browser, and how your device is performing.  * Information about the features you interact with on our Services. For example, when you use our devices, we may collect information on how often you use a certain feature, including from third parties.  * Information about you and your social media profile if you choose to access our Services with a social media profile. Please note that the information you share within the scope of those social media services, is not applicable to this Privacy policy. **Third parties may also collect information about you through the Services, or receive information collected about you through the Services, as described below.**  * Related companies  We may share your personal data within the Tobii group in order to develop and improve our products and Services. Such information, however, is anonymized to the best extent possible.  * Third party companies  Some of our Services offers the opportunity to use a social media account as an access method to the Service. If you choose to do so, that social media platform will receive information that you chose that access method at one of Tobii’s Services, and we will receive some types of information from the social media site. How that social media platform processes your information falls outside the scope of this Privacy policy. ## 2\. How do we use your personal data? We use the information as set out below and to provide our Services to you and our partners. Here's how: **To provide and personalize our Services.**  We use the information we collect to provide you with our Services. For example, we use this information to:  * Provide you with hardware, content, games, apps and other needs;  * Create accounts and user profiles;  * Communicate with you about our Services;  * Provide technical support;  * Notify you about updates to our Services; and  * Customize your usage based on your activities, including the content, games, apps and other experiences you interact with. This allows us to make our Services unique and relevant to you, for example by showing you content that is most relevant to you. **To improve and develop your experience and our Services.**  We also use the information that we collect to understand, develop and improve our Services. For example, we use the information to:  * Seek and analyse input and feedback about our Services;  * Identify and address technical issues on our Services;  * Conduct and learn from research about the ways in which people use our Services; and  * Improve services offered by others, such as third parties that offer games, apps and other content connected to our Services. **To promote our brand and Services.**  We use the information that we collect to send you promotional messages and content and otherwise market to you on and offer our Services. We also use this information to measure how users respond to our marketing efforts. If you would like to opt out of receiving marketing emails, then you can always do so by follow the instructions implemented in every such promotional message. **To promote safety and security.**  We use the personal data that we collect to help promote safety and security on and off our Services, such as by investigating suspicious activity or breaches of our terms or policies and protecting our or others’ rights or property. ## 3\. How is personal data shared? To provide and support our Services, information that we have about you is shared in certain circumstances. The following can see information about you when you and others use our Services. **Developers, support and other online content providers on our services.**  You can interact with Third-party content, games, apps and other experiences through our Services. We may share information about you with these partners so they can provide you with the experiences that you've requested, such as:  * Information in your Tobii profile and about how you use our Services. For example, we may provide a third-party games provider with your user id or similar, so that the games provider may deliver a game to you that you’ve purchased bundled with one of our products  * Any other information that you choose to share with the third party through your use of the Services.  * Sharing within related companies. Depending on which services you use, we share information with companies that are part of the same group of companies that Tobii is part of, or that become part of that group, such as Tobii Dynavox, Tobii Pro, and Tobii Tech. **Service providers.**  We share the information that we collect with vendors, service providers, researchers and other partners, who work at our direction to support the Services (such as hosting our Services, fulfilling orders, facilitating payments, analysing the way people use our Services, processing credit card payments, providing customer service or sending electronic communications for us). **Other parties in connection with certain business transactions.**  In the event that the ownership of Tobii (or any portion of our assets) changes as a result of a merger, acquisition or in the event of a bankruptcy, information from or about you or your device may be transferred to another company. **Law enforcement or legal requests.**  We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined in Section 7 below. We also share de-identified or aggregate data with others. “De-identified data” means information where we have removed identifiable data such as your name and other data that could reasonably be used to identify you. “Aggregate data” is data that has been combined with other data so that it doesn't identify any specific person. For example, we provide developers with aggregated statistics about the number of people from a particular region that use our Services, so developers can create content tailored for people in that market. ## 4\. How the Tobii companies work together  Tobii shares infrastructure, systems, and technology with other Tobii companies to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Services that you use. ## 5\. Third parties that provide content, marketing or functionality on our services Some of the content, marketing and functionality on our Services may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with us. For example, we work with companies that help us provide content within the Service that you purchased. ## 6\. Data retention and deletion We store data that identifies you until it is no longer necessary to provide our Services, for example when you delete an account with us. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things such as the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, we may retain certain purchase information for accounting and tax purposes even after you have deleted your account. When you delete an account with us, we delete or anonymize the data you provided us with and the data we collected during your use of the Services. Neither you nor us will be able to restore such deleted or anonymised data. ## 7\. How do we respond to legal requests and minimize harm? We access, preserve and share information with regulators, law enforcement or others:  * In response to a legal request where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.  * When we have a good faith belief that it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud or other illegal activity; to protect Tobii, our Services, you and others, including as part of investigations; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. ## 8\. How we operate and transfer data as part of our global services We share information globally, both internally within the Tobii Group and externally with our partners to fully provide the Services you are entitled to receive based on the Service you have purchased or subscribed to and/or otherwise are entitled to receive. Information controlled by Tobii will be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States, China and/or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are necessary for us to globally operate and provide our Services to you. We utilize standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission and rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, for data transfers from the EU/EEA to the United States and other countries. ## 9\. Changes to this policy If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will provide notice of such changes as appropriate, such as by sending you an email notification to the address that you've provided, and/or providing notice through the Services. If we make an administrative change, we may update the ""Last Updated"" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. The Data Protection Officer for Tobii AB can be contacted at [dpo@tobii.com](mailto:dpo@tobii.com). You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the Swedish lead supervisory authority, the Datainspektionen, [www.datainspektionen.se](http://www.datainspektionen.se/) ## 10\. What is our legal basis for processing data? The legal ground for processing personal data varies depending on the types of data and the situation. The legal grounds we rely on at Tobii are the following:  * If processing is necessary to fulfill our contract with you, i.e. what we are obliged to provide under the agreement between you and us. Our obligations to you vary depending on the Service you are using. For example, we may need to store your name and address to keep track of our warranty obligations to you.  * With your consent, which you may withdraw at any time. For example, when you have given your consent for Tobii to use your eye images and other personal data to develop our algorithms and thus our products. It should be noted that a withdrawal of a consent shall, and cannot, affect the lawfulness of processing that has already been carried out based on that consent before its withdrawal.  * As necessary to comply with our legal obligations; for example, Tobii must store some purchase information to comply with tax and accounting regulations. The legal ground for this processing (storing) is therefore necessary for compliance with legal obligations.  * Occasionally to protect your vital interests or those of others. On rare occasions, we may process your data if doing so is necessary to protect your vital interests. For example, in situations where there is an immediate risk to your health we may share information with your caregiver.  * As necessary for our (or others) legitimate interests. Tobii has a legitimate interest in providing an innovative, personalized, safe and profitable service to our existing and future users and partners, unless those interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protection of personal data. ## 11\. How can you exercise the rights provided to you under the GDPR? Under the General Data Protection Regulation, you have the right to: **Access your data**  You have the right to obtain from Tobii a confirmation of whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed, and if that is the case, a right to access information including, but not limited to, the purpose of the processing and the categories of personal data that Tobii has concerning you. By your request, Tobii is required to provide you with a copy of undergoing processing of your personal data. **Rectify your data**  If it comes to your knowledge that certain personal data of yours which is being processed by Tobii is inaccurate, you have the right to obtain a rectification and in some cases a right to have incomplete data completed. **Port your data**  If the legal ground for a processing of personal data is based on either (i) consent or (ii) fulfilment of a contract between you and Tobii, you have a right to receive data which you have provided us in a commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit such data to another controller. **Erase your data**  You have the right to obtain from Tobii the erasure of your personal data when, for example, (i) the data no longer is necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected, (ii) if you withdraw a consent, (iii) if you object to the processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or if (iv) the personal data have been unlawfully processed. **Restrict and object to certain processing of your data**  You have the right to restrict Tobii from processing your data when, for example, (i) you contest the accuracy of the personal data, or (ii) if Tobii no longer needs certain data for the purposes of the processing. Find out more about these rights, and how you can exercise them by either contacting Tobii at [dpo@tobii.com](mailto:dpo@tobii.com) or obtain information from the appropriate supervisory authority. ## 12\.

They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users. https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en##We occasionally use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.##Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site.

Alternatively, you can opt out by visiting the Network Advertising initiative opt out page or permanently using the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser add on.##California Online Privacy Protection Act##CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.##According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:##Users can visit our site anonymously.##Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.##Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’, and can be easily be found on the page specified above.##Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:##• On our Privacy Policy Page##Users are able to change their personal information:##• By emailing us##Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?##No, we don’t, but it’s also important to note that we allow third party behavioral tracking (Google Analytics).##COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)##When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.##We do not specifically market to children under 13.##Fair Information Practices##The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.##In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:##We will notify the users via email##• Within 7 business days##We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.##CAN SPAM Act##The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.##We collect your email address in order to:##– send you valuable information you requested and##– to process payments.##To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:##Every message we send to you will contain an ‘Unsbscribe’ link that, when clicked, will immediately delete your email address from our list database.##Contacting Us##If there are any questions regarding this privacy policy you may contact us using the information below.##affordable-internet-marketing.com##Postbus 132##5100 AC Dongen##Netherlands##https://www.affordable-internet-marketing.com/support/##Last Edited on 2016, Nov 14####Share this post using these icons:  ","When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address or other details to help you with your experience. ##Third Party Disclosure##We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information, unless we provide you with advance notice.##We use cookies to:##• Keep track of advertisements.##To administer a contest, promotion, survey, or other site feature. ##Do we use Malware Scanning via our hosting service.##Our website is scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our site as safe as possible.##If users disable cookies in their browser:##If you disable cookies, some features will be disabled.
